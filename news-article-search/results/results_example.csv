Report: Washington NFL team's recent executive hires questioned,07-23-2020 00:00,"The splashy, recent hires by the Washington NFL football team and its owner Daniel Snyder are being questioned by the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which assists the NFL in enforcing compliance of the Rooney Rule, ESPN’s The Undefeated reported Wednesday

Terry Batemen was named executive vice president and chief marketing officer Monday. This is the third go-round with the team for Bateman, who was the president of Snyder Communications marketing services from 1994-97.

The franchise followed that Tuesday by hiring Julie Donaldson as senior vice president of media. According to the team’s news release, Donaldson “will be the first female to be a regular on-air member of an NFL radio broadcast booth.”

The question is whether the team followed the procedures outlined in the league’s Rooney Rule …

Per The Undefeated:

… approved by owners May 19, clubs and the league office are required to interview “minorities and/or female applicants” for positions such as team president and “senior executives in communications, finance, human resources, legal, football operations, sales, marketing, sponsorship, information technology and security positions.” Moreover, there must be a credible process in which owners, or those they empower to make hires, interview multiple candidates and deliberate before picking one. In a text message to The Undefeated, the Fritz Pollard Alliance’s top decision-maker, Rod Graves,wrote, “The Fritz Pollard Alliance has sent inquiries to the NFL and to the Washington Football Team regarding the hiring process for Terry Bateman and Julie Donaldson.”

The article states there are questions whether Washington conducted thorough hiring processes as required by the Rooney Rule, two NFL club executives told The Undefeated.

The team is in crisis mode as its corporate sponsors are among those that forced it to undergo a “thorough review,” which led to the decision to change its nickname from what is considered a racist slur toward Native Americans.

That was followed by a Washington Post report detailing the awful corporate culture, where 15 women who formerly worked with the organization detailed sexual harassment. within it.",https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2020/07/23/washington-nfl-team-rooney-rule-daniel-snyder-terry-bateman-julie-donaldson-fritz-pollard-alliance/,0,Washington,USA,"""Washington"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
"USA Today, facing backlash, says Navarro opinion piece attacking Fauci does not meet its standards",07-16-2020 00:00,"Published online Tuesday evening and in print Wednesday, the opinion piece was authored by Peter Navarro, who heads the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, and was paired with the provocative headline: “Anthony Fauci has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on.”

On Wednesday evening, editorial page editor Bill Sternberg added a note that explained the piece’s origins as well as its mistakes.

AD

“Navarro’s response echoed comments made to other news outlets in recent days,” he wrote, alluding to talking points critical of Fauci circulated by White House aides. “We felt it was newsworthy because it expanded on those comments, put an on-the-record name to the attacks on Fauci, and contradicted White House denials of an anti-Fauci campaign.”

AD

But he said the piece “did not meet USA TODAY’s fact-checking standards” because of factual errors with “several of Navarro’s criticisms of Fauci.” In the piece, Navarro argued that Fauci “fought against the president’s courageous decision” to limit travel from China to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. That sentence now includes a link to an external fact-check of the claim that states that, “based on all available information, Trump was not accurate to say that Fauci criticized the president’s decision to restrict travel with China.”

As part of the publication’s response to the backlash that stemmed from publication of the piece, USA Today also published a “fact check” piece on Wednesday night that concluded “Peter Navarro’s claims about Dr. Anthony Fauci are misleading, lack context.”

AD

Sternberg wrote that USA Today “approached” Navarro to solicit the piece as part of the publication’s commitment to pairing an “opposing view” to an editorial board piece, also published on Tuesday evening, that largely hailed Fauci.

Beyond the appended editor’s note, USA Today has not commented publicly on the piece, which remains available online. A spokesperson directed The Washington Post to the revised version late Wednesday night.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2020/07/16/usa-today-facing-backlash-says-navarro-opinion-piece-attacking-fauci-did-not-meet-standards/,0,Washington,USA,"""Washington"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",

Chaplain says Washington Nationals’ World Series run is ‘story of faith’,07-24-2020 19:33,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — A baseball season and team are not often synonymous with religious or spiritual themes, but for Msgr. Stephen Rossetti, using words such as “miracle,” “grace” and “faith” are actually the best ways to describe the 2019 World Series champion Washington Nationals.

“It’s a story of hope. It’s a story of faith. It’s a story of mutual love and friendship,” said the priest, who has served as the Nationals’ team priest chaplain for the past 10 years. “It’s an inspiring story, a spiritual story, and it felt like a miracle.”

In a talk at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, Rossetti shared with several attendees the Gospel lessons, inspiration and blessings that continue to resonate from a Nationals’ season that began so bleakly, but against all odds rose to baseball’s highest peak Oct. 30, 2019.

“It was deeply moving for me and everybody. You could feel the electricity, something special was happening, a special spiritual grace happening,” said Rossetti, referring to the October playoff start. “The players, coaches and staff all felt the same.”

During the regular season, Rossetti, who also is a licensed psychologist and teaches theology at The Catholic University of America, celebrates Mass at Nationals Park for the players, coaches, staff, stadium crew and the visiting team before every Sunday home game. The priest said he offers prayers for a safe, healthy game, but he doesn’t pray specifically for a Nats’ win.

“I think God knows who I’m rooting for,” he joked.

After a nearly four-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic shutdown, the Nationals opened Major League Baseball’s regular season with a July 23 evening game against the New York Yankees at Nationals Park.

Due to COVID-19 safety precautions, no fans were going to be allowed in the stands, but the game was being televised on ESPN.

Throughout the past decade, Rossetti said he has gotten to know many of the Nationals’ front office staff and players. Although a majority of the players are young men between ages 19 and 28, he said they are respectful, mature and often faith-filled individuals.

“From top to bottom (of the Nats’ organization), they are really nice people,” he said in his July 2 talk at the museum.

Rossetti showed photographs of some of his favorite moments of the 2019 season, pointing out ways that remind him of the Gospel message. He said the team’s motto for the playoffs — “Stay in the Fight” — is a good example of the Christian virtue of hope.

“Don’t give up. … Hope is important for all our lives,” he said, adding that he told the players: “If you gave up, you wouldn’t be here (in the playoffs.) … It was inspiring that they never gave up.”

After the National League championship series win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Nationals Park, team manager Davey Martinez reflected on the rough start to the season, telling the overjoyed crowd, “Bumpy roads lead to beautiful places. And this is a beautiful place!”

Rossetti said this is the same notion as the Paschal Mystery. “We must go through the darkness to get to the Resurrection,” he said. “We all pay our dues. There are no easy lives. The Lord is with us, and walks with us.”

He also commended the Nationals for their great team effort all season long and during the playoffs and World Series, an example of the Christian ideal that every individual is important and counts.

“Each guy had their own moment. Davey believed in them and each guy rose to the moment and contributed,” he said.

Rossetti also shared more personal insights on the championship season, including how moved he was to witness the transformation of Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg, whom he described as shy, but had come out of his shell thanks in part to teammates Gerardo Parra and Anibal Sanchez.

“It really was the most touching moment of the playoff series,” he said, showing a photo of the three players in a jubilant group hug.

“It’s really been a personal journey for him. He’s grown up, gotten married, had children,” the priest said. “Life becomes for you your own Gospel story.”

Rossetti really became a baseball fan when the Nationals first arrived in the nation’s capital in 2005.

Fifteen years later and with a World Series championship on the books, Rossetti said he feels very blessed to support the team and help keep the Lord present in their lives — win or lose.

But the season that ended with the championship, in particular, he said was a grace-filled experience that can serve to remind everyone of God’s love and care for all.

“It was a joy to be part of the Nationals’ season in a modest way. I thank the Lord for that grace, and I hope whatever happens (this season), they will do well and ‘Stay in the Fight,’” Rossetti said.

"Giancarlo Stanton homers, Yankees beat Nationals in rain-shortened MLB opener",07-23-2020 00:00,"WASHINGTON – A World Series banner was raised Thursday night, with nobody around to cheer its ascent.

A nationally revered doctor threw out the first pitch, but there was no curtain call to take, nor any reason to be red-faced after he pulled it comically away from his catcher.

A virtually empty Nationals Park, playing host to the first regular season game among the four major North American sports leagues since a pandemic shut them all down in March and shut many of us in, could not contain the voices of Washington Nationals and New York Yankees players, whose chatter echoed through the park.

Nor could it contain the baseball struck by Giancarlo Stanton, who greeted Max Scherzer and this evolving concept of pandemic baseball with a vicious swing of his bat, sending the sphere hurtling into vacated seats outside something called the “Budweiser Brew House,” where there were no imbibing fans to greet its arrival.

MLB 2020: Postseason expanded to 16 teams

DODGERS-GIANTS: Betts, Kapler among those to take a knee

Stanton’s jolt, and the expected brilliance of new Yankees ace Gerrit Cole, fed a baseball-starved national TV audience some long-awaited red meat, and kick-started a 4-1 Yankees victory in a 2020 season opener deferred four months by the novel coronavirus.

In keeping with these challenging times, though, the game was not played to completion. A menacing thunderstorm circled the area and finally touched down on South Capitol Street shortly before 9 p.m. ET, and the game was not resumed after a delay was called with one out in the top of the sixth inning. Both teams hung around nearly two hours before the game was officially called.

It was so very 2020. But it was probably just as well.

Scherzer was more or less done, mixing stretches of brilliance – he struck out 11 Yankees – with the occasional hiccup against a Yankee offense that signaled it may be as punishing on the field as it is on paper.

Especially when both Aaron Judge and Stanton are healthy.

The corner outfielders both battled maladies this spring and summer but appear good to go. Judge singled off Scherzer in the first and then Stanton unloaded on a 94-mph Scherzer cutter, the crack of the bat and the clang of its arrival echoing throughout the nearly deserted ballpark.

""We’re facing the world champs, we’re facing Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole’s on the mound for us, our guys came out with an edge and you could sense that in the dugout,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.

Stanton also drove in their final run with a fifth-inning single, not that Cole needed the extra cushion.

He was untouchable after yielding a first-inning home run to Adam Eaton, giving up no more hits to an emaciated Nationals lineup that lost Anthony Rendon to free agency and 21-year-old budding star Juan Soto to a positive test for the coronavirus.

That jolting news Thursday afternoon cast an immediate pall over the opener, a grim reminder of the risks the players will assume to get this season in, although Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo reported that Soto is asymptomatic.

Without their 21-year-old who drove in 110 runs and hit five postseason home runs, the Nationals inserted Andrew Stevenson in left field and the eighth spot in the lineup. He was badly overmatched by Cole, who struck out the career .241 hitter on five pitches in the second and four pitches in the fifth.

Cole may find tougher lineups throughout the all-East 60-game schedule the Yankees must navigate, but his precision Thursday was nonetheless compelling. He fired 10 pitches at least 96 mph, dotting the outside corner with ease.

He pitched from the same mound in his last start that mattered, Game 5 of the World Series against these Nationals. Cole dominated them that night, too, striking out nine over seven innings of a 7-1 win.

But he was a Houston Astro then, and the Nationals came back to win the final two games of that Series in Houston. Cole didn’t get into Game 7 in relief and six weeks later was a Yankee, his $324 million contract the richest ever for a pitcher.

The wait for his debut in pinstripes was much longer: A four-month delay due to the coronavirus.

It ended after he threw just 75 pitches, weather, not the pandemic, to blame.

""I said to (wife) Amy, I can’t believe I’m going to get a complete-game one-hitter in my debut,"" he noted.

Cole’s contract runs for nine years, with hopes for games of much greater consequence than Thursday’s.

YMCA CEO Kevin Washington on Balancing Pandemic Response and Financial Pressures,,"(Miss this week’s The Leadership Brief? This interview above was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, July 19; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world’s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.

The YMCA, under CEO Kevin Washington, has played an important role in propping up the nation’s fraying safety net during a pandemic that has also taken a severe financial toll on the Y. More than 1,000 Y’s have been involved in some form of emergency food distribution, often working with local partners. Many Y’s have seen their food-distribution efforts increase tenfold. The Y has played a critical role in caring for the children of essential workers, looking after up to 40,000 kids in June alone. The Y’s also converted spaces into homeless shelters, partnered with the Red Cross on blood drives and helped check in on seniors and members of vulnerable communities to help ward off loneliness. Now the organization is reopening day camps during the crucial summer months.

Meanwhile, a pause in gym memberships helped account for the Y’s $800 million revenue shortfall for April and May. A handful of Y’s have shut down, and more closures are likely. To keep afloat, more than 500 Y’s across the U.S. received paycheck-protection loans from the federal government.

Washington, 66, is the first African-American CEO of the YMCA of the USA; he started working at the Y 42 years ago as a youth-program director, after first becoming involved in Y programs when he was 10. He credits the Y with providing him a safe alternative to gang life on the streets of South Philadelphia. Washington joined TIME for a video conversation to talk about pivoting during the crisis, diversity in Y leadership, and what young people expect of today’s leaders.

This interview with YMCA of the USA CEO Kevin Washington has been edited and condensed for clarity.

A U.S. Census Bureau report recently found that about 25 million Americans aren’t getting enough food to eat during the week. How has the Y helped address that situation?

We knew with schools closed that communities would be destitute in looking for food, particularly because of the significant unemployment issues [and] furloughs that were being dealt with. The Y stepped up and partnered with food banks and other entities to ensure that there was a continuous supply of food for those kids and families that needed it.

What does it say about this country that so many people are living so close to the edge, that they are in need of emergency food?

It continues to show the significant inequities that exist in this country. And the thing that the pandemic has done is highlighted them. The question for us is, what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about it as a country? The significant number of inequities—they’re staring us in the face. And this is not about politics. It’s about basic dignity and basic necessities that we want all people to have.

How is the Y helping chart the path forward?

First, in order for us as an organization, we have got to work on ourselves. You cannot address inequities in this country if you haven’t done the work on yourself first and foremost. You’ve got to understand that what we have before us didn’t just happen. It’s been with us for over 400 years.

You’re the first African-American CEO. How old is the Y?

It’s 176 years old.

The word overdue is coming up a lot lately in conversations.

What I will tell you is that as a person who grew up in the ’60s, and seeing some of the things that have happened in the civil rights movement and beyond, I will tell you that I’m sad. I’m frustrated. I’m angry. But I’m hopeful.

Why?

I’m hopeful because of what I see in the streets today is what I would call a rainbow coalition of people. Particularly young people. My heart is with young people. I see young people who really are different, have different perspectives, have different understandings about what diversity, inclusion and equity mean. So I’m very hopeful.

So it feels different than the ’60s?

It feels different. But what I want to see is how do we address practices and policies and laws? Great, monuments are coming down. It’s good for public relations. Practices, policies, laws is what I want to see.

You are putting your faith in young people?

I say this all the time, that nothing’s changed in any country, any revolution, on any issue, unless it was led by young people. People forget Martin Luther King Jr. was 26 when he started. When George Williams founded the YMCA, he was 22.

You mentioned looking at your own organization. How has the Y done? Are you satisfied with diversity at the Y?

I don’t know if you ever could be satisfied. You always want to be better. We have a good team of people from a diversity inclusion perspective. We can be better. We need to be better, our leaders, who lead that movement across the country. We’re not where we need to be. Absolutely not.

A lot of organizations with storied histories are looking back at their own records and finding things that they’re not proud of and taking steps to change. What about the Y?

We are an American institution. It’s been around since 1851 in the States. [The organization was founded in 1844 in London.] We represent the history of America. So all those things that were prevalent within the American society are reflected in the YMCA. If you look at the history of America, from 1851 on, you look at the history of the Y because we were part of that. We had segregated Y’s. We can’t deny it. It’s real.

Let’s shift to another service that you provided during the pandemic, taking care of the children of essential workers. How did that come about when Y’s were forced to close?

We pivoted. First and foremost, the Y is by any stretch of imagination the largest provider of child-development services in the country. Period. It was very essential. There’s no way the economy can open or those kinds of services couldn’t be provided because people had kids and families that needed to be taken care of. Doctors, first responders, people in grocery stores, drugstores. They needed somewhere to put their kids with schools being closed.

First and foremost, the Y is by any stretch of imagination the largest provider of child-development services in the country. Period. - Kevin Washington, CEO of the YMCA of the USA

The Y is also a huge part of many seniors’ lives, and the pandemic has taken a toll on older people. What have you done in that area?

We’ve got 22 million YMCA members across this country. A million of them are seniors. And many of them are living alone. The Y is this socialization place where they come together to meet, engage with people. And so when that’s taken away from them, there’s a sense of isolation that can develop. Many YMCAs took it upon themselves to make sure they reached out to those individuals, to make sure they were getting what they needed. Make sure they were connecting with them. Doing Zoom classes with them. Having Zoom conversations with them. To ensure that there was an opportunity for them to connect with other human beings. To help prevent social isolation and depression.

And now it’s summertime, camp season. What is happening with your day camps and sleepaway camps?

The first is most of our what we call resident camps, sleepaway camps, have decided not to open. Our day camps? Many of them are operating. Because they are really essential services extended for kids and families.

You’ve been busy.

I should add that we were around in 1918 and went through a pandemic before too.

This is not your first pandemic.

I don’t want to do this ever, ever, ever again.

How much of what you’re doing do you feel like is an essential service that the government should be providing?

That’s why we asked them for money. [Laughs.] Here’s the reality. What the government has the capacity to do is to give resources to the nonprofit sector like the Y and others, to do this work on their behalf. And do it at a much deeper level, less expensive, and in a much more authentic way because they have the relationships in those communities.

Did Y’s access the PPP?

Many YMCAs were able to access PPP money. And I will tell you for many of them, that was a lifeblood to support them through this process.

This has taken a tremendous financial toll on the Y, right?

One of the reasons why we went after the federal government to get resources—just in the month of April, the losses of revenue for the movement approached $400 million. One month.

How concerned are you about the financial health of the Y system?

I’m very concerned, because like most nonprofits, most of our YMCAs don’t have significant reserves. We’re sure that there will be some YMCAs that will not be able to survive.

When did you first encounter the Y?

I was born and raised in South Philadelphia. They had youth directors that would go to schools and form these clubs of boys. Unfortunately, it was only boys then. I was 10 years old at the time. The Christian Street YMCA: still there today. My mom would always ask where I was. I was at the Y. I learned to volunteer there. My brother, we had a church [basketball] league on Friday nights that involved most of the churches in the community. I wasn’t old enough or good enough at that time to play. I kept score. And I cleaned the gym.

What kind of neighborhood was it? What were the alternatives?

There weren’t too many. When I grew up, either you were going to get involved in sports or a street gang. And I was fortunate enough to get engaged in sports and sidestep some of the other issues that a lot of my friends fell into. That was because of the Y.

Are you still in touch with your friends that took another path?

Several of them are no longer with us. I lost my first friend, his name was Chuckie, he was 13. He got stabbed. He was 13. He died. Some of my best friends … no longer with us. Losing those relationships at an early age, it’s very tough. The Y helped me. The Y kept me from that. It gave me a place, a safe haven.

What was your home life like growing up?

We weren’t the richest family in the world. But we were rich in terms of our relationships. I’m number four of six. My mother and father were there, and took care of us. Whatever pennies they could put together, we always, always had a good time. Didn’t have much. But we had a great family in terms of our ability and our love for each other. We still have that today.

What character traits did your parents infuse in you that you bring to work with you every day?

Watching my father who worked as a packer in an assembly line. Didn’t make a lot of money. But I could count the days on my hands that he missed work. We watched him when he was sick, when he was tired. Always got up on Monday morning and went to work. My mother, had she been in a different era, she would have gone to college and graduated. Smart, read books. Took care of the house. Made sure we got what we needed, meals and everything. Hard worker, took care of us. And put some discipline in us. She made us do our chores.

We’re sure that there will be some YMCAs that will not be able to survive. - Kevin Washington, CEO of the YMCA of the USA

What did your father pack at work?

Lamps. He worked there for probably 35 years.

You went to Temple University on a basketball scholarship. What position did you play? Did you have a go-to move?

I was a guard. I had a mean crossover. I was left-handed, and everybody would try to play me to my left. They couldn’t stop it.

Do you still play basketball?

Not anymore. I watch it a lot. But I don’t play it anymore. I’m old. I’ve got a belly that gets in the way quite a bit for my jump shot.

What was your first paid job at the Y?

I was the youth-program director, 1978, $10,000 a year. I was rich. [Laughs.]

And now you are running it, 42 years later.

Well, let me just say this. For a person who’s grown up in the ’60s and now 66 years old, it’s different. It’s different because we have so many of our young people who work for us, and I’m sure that you probably experience it at TIME, is that they expect and demand a different kind of leadership. They’re not as patient with the status quo or the hierarchy of an organization or a company. And there’s no question, not only do I feel it, but all of our leaders who lead YMCAs across the country feel that pressure of young folks pushing us. And sometimes uncomfortably, but pushing us to areas that we may not want to go as quickly as they want us to go there.

It’s a tricky time to be in charge.

It’s a very tricky time. You’re balancing what you know folks want. What you need to do—and they expect you to take a stand. They don’t want to hear. You have to take a stand.

"Nationals star Juan Soto tests positive for COVID-19, will miss opener vs. Yankees",07-23-2020 00:00,"Major League Baseball’s prime-time return amid the COVID-19 pandemic was dealt an unsettling blow when one of its greatest young stars tested positive for the novel coronavirus before he could take the field in 2020.

Juan Soto, the Washington Nationals’ dazzling 21-year-old outfielder, was omitted from the opening-day roster after a positive test for COVID-19, general manager Mike Rizzo confirmed Thursday, just hours before the defending World Series champions were to open the season with a nationally-televised game against the New York Yankees.

Soto was among a group of Nationals who were quarantined for 14 days at the outset of the team’s “summer camp” in Washington after he flew on an MLB-chartered flight from the Dominican Republic to Miami with a passenger who ultimately tested positive for COVID-19. Soto rejoined the team July 16 and played in exhibition games against Philadelphia and Baltimore.

Rizzo says Soto is asymptomatic after taking the test Tuesday and receiving the results Thursday morning, and says no other Nationals will be unavailable for the opener due to contact tracing ramifications. Nationals manager Dave Martinez said Soto tested negative four times before Thursday's positive result.

As part of its plan to return to play following a nearly four-month shutdown due to COVID-19, players are tested every other day, with results expected to be delivered within 24 to 48 hours. Soto is at least the 70th MLB player to publicly acknowledge testing positive; the vast majority of those positives occurred during intake testing around July 1 or earlier this summer.

Even if Soto is healthy, the positive test result will sideline him for a significant portion of MLB's 60-game season. There is no specified isolation period in MLB's health and safety protocols, but a player must test negative in consecutive tests at least 24 hours apart, pass a health screening and be approved by doctors from MLB and the players' association.

Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman tested negative for COVID-19 at the start of summer camp, but produced a positive test taken around July 9. While Yankees GM Brian Cashman said Wednesday that Chapman is asymptomatic and working out at home, he continues testing positive for COVID-19.

Soto played in an exhibition against the Orioles as recently as Tuesday night; MLB's health and safety protocols released before players returned to team facilities notes that only players who have come into ""close contact,"" as defined by the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) must pass an expedited diagnostic test and be tested every day for seven consecutive days.

The CDC's definition of ""close contact"" is someone ""living in the same household, being within six feet of someone for fifteen minutes or longer, or being in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on). Close contact does not include brief interactions, such as walking past someone.""

Soto hit 34 home runs and drove in 110 runs for the Nationals in 2019, and then added five more home runs in the postseason, including three in their seven-game World Series triumph over the Houston Astros.

""It crushed me when I found out,"" Martinez said on a video call Thursday.

No player took a knee, ending speculation that players might choose to do so as the country’s racial reckoning continues. Instead, they demonstrated in other ways. Some wore “Black Lives Matter” T-shirts during pregame warmups, and many had the slogan affixed to a small patch on their game uniforms.

The demonstration to kneel with the black cloth, according to a report Thursday by the Athletic, is part of a leaguewide players initiative to hold a “moment of unity” before each Opening Day game and is being led by Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Andrew McCutchen.

Players on the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants took part in the same ceremony before their opener later Thursday night, with each holding on to the black cloth while kneeling. But some members of both teams remained on their knees as the national anthem was played. Mookie Betts was the lone Dodgers player to kneel, and a couple of teammates put their hands on his shoulders in support. San Francisco Giants Manager Gabe Kapler and several of his players also took a knee during the anthem.

The players were distanced in front of the dugouts during the ceremony, a precautionary measure as the league began its 60-game schedule amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

There were reminders of the pandemic everywhere Thursday night — missing was Nationals outfielder Juan Soto, who tested positive for the virus, while Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, threw out the ceremonial first pitch — but the baseball’s efforts to stand against racial injustice were also at the forefront.

Fauci threw out the first pitch on a mound that had “BLM” stenciled into the dirt. Players were also given the option this week to wear patches on their jerseys that read “Black Lives Matter” or “United For Change,” and MLB lifted cleat restrictions so they could put social justice messages on their spikes.

Protests against racial injustice and police brutality have permeated sports in the wake of Floyd’s death in May. Since then, players across professional sports have taken a knee during the anthem to protest, just as former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had before NFL games in 2016.

This week, Kapler and several of his players took a knee during the anthem before an exhibition game, which drew quick criticism from President Trump in a tweet. A Los Angeles Angels pitcher also knelt and raised his fist during the national anthem before an exhibition game Monday, and four Cincinnati Reds players also took a knee during the anthem before another game Tuesday.

AD

That led some to wonder whether there would be demonstrations during the national anthem Thursday night. A day earlier, Major League Baseball — which in 2019 had just 68 African American players among the 882 players on Opening Day rosters, injured lists and restricted lists, according to USA Today — rolled out options for players to recognize the movement against racial injustice during the shortened season.

AD

As teams opened summer camp in early July, some reportedly held meetings throughout the month to address social issues. The Nationals held a meeting Tuesday, with closer Sean Doolittle telling his teammates that he would kneel with them if they chose to do so.

But that moment never came before Thursday night’s game in Washington, and many players placed their hands over their hearts as D.C. Washington sang a precorded version of the national anthem. Doolittle later caught the first pitch by Fauci, and the season was soon underway.

"After Attacks From Trump Aides, Fauci Says ‘Let’s Stop This Nonsense’ and Focus on Virus",07-15-2020 00:00,"“He’s a valued member of our team,” Mr. Pence told the TV host Greta Van Susteren in an interview, adding that administration officials “have great respect for him.”

Dr. Fauci, 79, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a post he has held since 1984, is no stranger to criticism. He oversaw much of the government’s response to the AIDS epidemic, weathering criticism from activists like Larry Kramer, who called him a “murderer” and an “incompetent idiot.”

Mr. Trump’s administration presents a different challenge. Because Dr. Fauci is a career civil servant, his job is not in jeopardy, and it is unlikely that Mr. Trump can completely exile him, given his emergence as the government’s most credible voice on the pandemic. He has not briefed Mr. Trump in weeks, preferring to work with Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who helps coordinate the administration’s coronavirus response, or to send his messages through Mr. Pence.

Without directly criticizing the president — both men have emphasized their personal fondness for each other — Dr. Fauci has begun fighting back.

On Monday, he met with Mr. Meadows to discuss his ability to speak about the virus on television — his broadcast appearances have been sharply curbed in recent weeks by Mr. Meadows and members of the communications staff. And in The Atlantic interview, Dr. Fauci complained that the administration’s actions had made it difficult for health officials to communicate accurate information.

“It distracts from what I hope would be the common effort of getting this thing under control, rather than this back-and-forth distraction, which just doesn’t make any sense,” Dr. Fauci said. “We’ve got to almost reset this and say, ‘OK, let’s stop this nonsense.’ We’ve got to figure out, how can we get our control over this now, and, looking forward, how can we make sure that next month, we don’t have another example of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona?”",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/us/politics/fauci-navarro-coronavirus.html,0,Washington,USA,"""Washington"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
USA Today: Navarro’s anti-Fauci column didn’t meet standards,07-16-2020 16:18,"FILE – White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is now serving as national defense production act policy coordinator, speaks in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington on April 2, 2020. USA Today says that Navarro’s column about Dr. Anthony Fauci that it solicited and published did not meet its fact-checking standards.

NEW YORK (AP) — USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro’s column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday’s newspaper.

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, “has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.”

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check storyby Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro’s claims.

It wasn’t clear how Navarro’s column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he’s letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last monththat an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn’t been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro’s opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci “a national treasure.”

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint “shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.”

It wasn’t clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he’s publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro’s column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro’s views and “he shouldn’t be doing that.”

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that “might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives.” USA Today said there isn’t enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci’s early statements of concern about the virus.",https://wgnradio.com/news/political-news/usa-today-navarros-anti-fauci-column-didnt-meet-standards/,0,Washington,USA,"""Washington"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",

The number of county residents known to be in the infectious stage of the disease rose by six Friday, according to Lane County Public Health. The total number is 48.

Two people are hospitalized. More than 37,500 people have been tested.

The Oregon Health Authority on Friday reported there were 396 new cases statewide, bringing the total to 16,104. There were nine new deaths, bringing the total to 282.

What’s your take on state’s early child care guidance?

Gov. Kate Brown is seeking Oregonians’ opinions on newly proposed changes to COVID-19 guidance for child care and early learning programs.

Brown announced the new draft guidance in a news release Thursday. The newest version builds on the guidance last updated in May and expands requirements on children’s mask use, family engagement and group sizes.

The guidance was reviewed by the Healthy Early Learners Council this week, and the governor’s office is taking public input on the changes online until Sunday, in both English and Spanish.

24 million Americans fear missing next rent payment

Days from the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and a federal eviction moratorium, 24 million Americans say they have little to no chance of being able to pay next month’s rent, a U.S. Census Bureau survey shows.

A disproportionate share of those in danger come from Black and Hispanic households, two groups who have borne the brunt of negative health and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

While Congress works to negotiate a new stimulus, experts warn the time to ward off an eviction and foreclosure crisis has almost run out.

""We're about to fall off a massive cliff and see a major spike in evictions,"" said Alanna McCargo, vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute.

After a week of accepting applications for federal rental assistance, Lane County now need to go through the 1,555 completed applications. A total of $5.1 million is available via the federal COVID-19 CARES Act and will be distributed in a lottery-type fashion for rent expenses since March 1.

The amount of people in need of help is startling, but not surprising, said Devon Ashbridge, a spokesperson for Lane County.

""We’re going to do everything we can to stretch funding and help as many people as possible but it really depends on what each applicant needs,"" Ashbridge said.

Open letter from health professionals

It's time to hit the reset button: Shut it down and restart. That's what more than 150 health professionals are urging government leaders in an open letter published earlier this week.

""Tell the American people the truth about the virus, even when it’s hard. Take bold action to save lives — even when it means shutting down again,"" the letter, spearheaded by the nonprofit U.S. Public Interest Research Group, says.

Public health leaders argue in the letter that the U.S. reopened too quickly, nonessential businesses should close again, Americans should mostly stay home, and government officials need to invest more in testing, contact tracing, and personal protective equipment capacities.

""If you don’t take these actions, the consequences will be measured in widespread suffering and death,"" according to the letter addressed to President Donald Trump, federal officials and governors.

Fauci says he has security after threats to him, family

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he has received security amid heightened threats to him and his family. Fauci made the comments on CNN's ""The Axe Files"" podcast and said that many of the threats come from people who are angry and believe, ""I'm interfering with their life because I'm pushing a public health agenda.""

The longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said he has been a target since the early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as the first government official speaking out about the virus. He said he received hate mail then but could largely ignore it. The backlash he's received during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is of a different magnitude, he said.

""The kind of not only hate mail but actual, serious threats against me are not good,"" Fauci said. ""It's tough. Serious threats against me, against my family, my daughters, my wife. I mean, really? Is this the United States of America? But it's real. It really is real.""

Fauci added: ""We are all trying to open up American again in a way that is safe, that we can do it in a measured fashion. But the hostility against public health issues is difficult to not only understand but difficult to even process.""

In a recent interview with the business news outlet MarketWatch, Fauci also said he would not eat inside a restaurant or get on a flight given the current state of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.

Poll: 3 in 4 Americans want mask wearing required

An overwhelming 3 out of 4 Americans support requiring people to wear masks in public, a new poll found.

Almost 90% of Democrats as well as nearly 60% of Republicans support requiring masks outside of people's homes. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll was conducted before President Donald Trump, who had been dismissive of wearing masks despite public health officials' support, tweeted earlier this week that wearing a face covering is patriotic.

Although partisan rhetoric around masks has undermined what public health officials say is a simple step that can save lives, 95% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans say they’re wearing face coverings when leaving the house.

The poll also found about two-thirds of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the pandemic.

Coronavirus is tearing through Latino communities – and it may get worse

The coronavirus’ continued rampage through the southern and western United States is almost certain to leave an especially deadly trail among Latinos, who not only represent a significant percentage of the population in those regions but often face structural conditions that make them more vulnerable.

A new study published Thursday, the first nationwide analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths among Latinos, concludes that crowded housing arrangements and high-risk jobs in industries like meatpacking, poultry and hospitality are among the major reasons Latinos have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

As the virus extracts a heavy toll on California, Texas and Florida — the three states with the largest Latino populations — the death count among the country’s biggest minority group could be staggering.

""My prediction is that it’s very likely because the policies and practices that are needed to prevent infections and deaths are not in place,’’ said Carlos Rodriguez-Diaz, the study's lead author.

CDC guidelines for schools: Wear masks, wash hands, don't touch

Parent check-list for back-to-school: Label your child's face mask with permanent marker. Have them practice putting on and taking off their mask without touching the cloth. Make a labeled, resealable plastic bag to store their mask during lunch time. Those are among the suggestions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for school administrators and parents as families prepare for school to resume in the fall.

Students should wear masks, wash their hands frequently and socially distance to protect against COVID-19 as schools reopen this fall, CDC urged in new guidance documents for administrators published Thursday. ""It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,"" said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in a release.

CDC, the nation's top public health agency, has faced considerable political pressure from President Donald Trump and others to get schools reopened.

A key consideration for school administrators, CDC said, was COVID-19 transmission rates in their communities. But the CDC guidance offered no specific metrics for what transmission rates would require specific actions.

GOP backs more stimulus checks, funds for schools in new aid package

Senate Republicans were scrambling Thursday to finalize a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package that will include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and additional funding to help schools recover from the pandemic.

GOP leaders and the White House said late Wednesday that they had agreed on key parts of the legislation, which will serve as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who have already passed their own bill in the House.

But Republicans are still struggling to put the finishing touches on the package. Congress and the White House are under pressure to clinch a deal on a fresh pandemic aid package; a federal program of expanded unemployment benefits is set to run out within days.

One item that will be missing from the GOP plan is Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut. Republicans abandoned that proposal even though Trump had suggested he might not sign any bill that doesn’t include it.

Arizona governor announces guidelines for schools reopening

Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered public health officials to choose data by Aug. 7 for schools to rely on when deciding when to reopen schools for in-person classes. When schools reopen, everyone will be required to wear masks, with some exceptions for students, Ducey added.

The plan comes with another major requirement for schools. Under the order, schools will be required to reopen for on-site learning on Aug. 17 for students who have nowhere else to go. That means, Superintendent Kathy Hoffman said, districts have to open at least one site for students to go, but do not have to open every school or require every teacher to show up to work in-person. Schools also are required to provide distance learning as an option.

New CDC guidelines: People with mild to moderate COVID-19 only need to isolate 10 days

People who have had mild to moderate COVID-19 can come out of isolation after 10 days and don't need to be retested before going back to work, new CDC guidelines say. Symptoms, not testing, are the guide. If patients had a fever, it needs to have been gone for at least 24 hours.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document, published Wednesday, says symptoms are a better gauge of how infectious someone is so they are ""not kept unnecessarily isolated and excluded from work or other responsibilities.""

The document acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is so new that doctors are still gathering evidence for how it works. As more data becomes available, the medical community is gaining a better understanding of how people who are infected can avoiding passing on the disease. The new guidelines reflect the latest thinking.

Amtrak tightens face mask requirement

Amtrak on Thursday joined U.S. air carriers in tightening face mask requirements, saying passengers could be removed or banned from its trains for non-compliance. The railroad service had begun requiring face masks in May, but had allowed passengers to remove them when seated alone. Now, passengers can only remove their masks when they're in private rooms, an option only available on the company's long-distance trains.

""Amtrak reserves the right to remove customers or ban them from future travel in the event of noncompliance with Amtrak's face covering policy,"" Amtrak said on its website.

Trump cancels Jacksonville portion of RNC due to COVID-19

President Donald Trump announced Thursday he is canceling the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention because of the coronavirus pandemic, a major setback in his effort to energize his struggling bid for reelection. ""The timing for this event is not right,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""There's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe.""

Trump said that he would deliver remarks to formally accept his party's nomination for president but offered no detail on where or when that will happen. The abrupt decision was not only a significant blow to his campaign but also raised questions about the president's narrative that the country is ready to reopen for business.

Trump said convention delegates will still gather in North Carolina, where the official business of the convention was set to take place, and formally nominate him for reelection.

Late Thursday, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez reaffirmed that his party will hold its national convention next month in Milwaukee, with a mostly virtual event. Delegates will vote remotely. Joe Biden has said he intends to accept the nomination in Milwaukee

AMC Theatres delays reopening again

AMC Theatres is delaying its planned reopening date again amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in dozens of states. The movie theater chain said Thursday that it is now planning to reopen its U.S. locations in ""mid to late August.""

The company had previously set its reopening date for July 15 and then delayed it to July 30. But sharp increases in COVID-19 cases in states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, coupled with Hollywood delaying film releases, have combined to make a swift return to indoor moving showings implausible.

Florida, Texas among states with deadliest weeks

A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Wednesday shows 12 states set records for new cases over a seven-day period while six states had a record number of deaths over the period. New case records were set in Alaska, California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Record numbers of deaths were reported in Florida, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

In Florida, the week's death toll was 824, more than twice the number of any week during the spring COVID-19 surge. Still, Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to press for in-classroom learning when schools open, some in less than three weeks. DeSantis stressed that young people face the least risk from the virus.

""It is our kids who have borne the harshest burden of the controlled measures instituted to protect against the virus,"" DeSantis said Wednesday.

Oregon virus cases could reach 1,600 a day in August

SALEM — The Oregon Health Authority's latest coronavirus projections predict that, based on the current rate of cases, the state will have 1,600 new confirmed infections a day by mid-August.

In a more ""pessimistic"" model, officials said if transmission increases by 10 percentage points from the current rates, there could be 2,300 new daily confirmed infections and 46 hospitalizations a day.

In the month of July, Oregon has averaged about 315 cases a day. On Thursday officials reported 331 new cases and two deaths, raising the state's total case count to 15,713. The death toll is 273.

Good to see cases starting to slow down, Lane County says

There total number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Lane County on Thursday rose by seven from the day before to 419, according to public health spokesman Jason Davis.

That increase is larger than most of the days in the first months of the pandemic in Lane County, but lower than most newer daily case counts. Over the weekend, Lane County saw a single day with 40 new cases, the highest one-day increase so far.

""It is good to see that our cases are starting to slow down. It’s definitely too soon to call that a win, but it is encouraging,"" Davis said at Thursday’s public health briefing.

Two Lane County residents currently are hospitalized with COVID-19. Davis said people from other counties with COVID-19 also are using local hospitals.

Davis said 42 Lane County residents are known to be infectious at this time.

More than 35,500 locals have been tested so far. The positivity rate is less than 1%. Davis said the county is averaging about 600 novel coronavirus tests per day.

Between July 13-19:

– Lane County confirmed 73 new cases

– 35.6% of those cases were community transmission, meaning there is no known exposure point or existing cases linked to their getting sick

– about 14.7% of those cases were household transmission

– there were around 315 people being monitored as having been possibly exposed to those 73 news cases

– 86% of cases were in adjacent zip codes to the Eugene-Springfield metro area.

– nearly 50% of total cases since the pandemic started are under the age of 30

– about 16% of total cases since the pandemic started are between the ages 41-60

– about 6.3% of total cases since the pandemic started were over the age of 70

Starting Friday, children age 5 and up are required to wear a face covering.

Face coverings are now required when exercising indoors, plus outdoors when people can’t keep appropriate physical distance. People with a disability or medical condition may request accommodation from the business if they cannot wear a mask.

U.S. hits 4 million cases of COVID-19

The U.S. hit the latest bleak milestone Thursday in the historic and deadly pandemic: 4 million confirmed cases of infections.

And experts agree the number of cases is actually much greater — potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, almost 150,000 people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus as the nation continues to lead the world for most cases and deaths.

""We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in a Facebook Live interview July 6. ""And I would say, this would not be considered a wave. It was a surge, or a resurgence of infections superimposed upon a baseline.""

"California, Oregon roll back reopenings as new coronavirus cases surge",07-13-2020 00:00,"The coronavirus pandemic and its accompanying economic tremors have forced at least 5.4 million people out of health insurance, a new analysis found — a staggering, record-setting increase in the number of Americans uninsured.

The report, published Monday by the health-care advocacy group Families USA, showed that widespread layoffs caused more adults to lose coverage between February and May than ever have in a full year.

Nearly half of those who lost insurance reside in just five states: California, Texas, Florida, New York and North Carolina. And even more troubling: Most of the states that now have the highest share of uninsured adults — including Texas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas — are also battling surges of new infections and rising rates of hospitalizations.

The historic number of newly uninsured people should prompt Congress to address the issue of health coverage in the next virus relief bill, the study’s author, Stan Dorn, wrote.

“No federal covid-19 legislation signed into law has attempted to restore or preserve comprehensive health insurance, which improves health outcomes, limits financial insecurity, and promotes economic recovery,” Dorn wrote. “Federal lawmakers can fill that gap in the next covid-19 bill.”

The analysis is based on unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and Urban Institute research on the number of unemployed workers who become uninsured instead of finding coverage elsewhere. The findings reflect the economic reality of May, the most recent month for which data was available.

"Federal agents in unmarked cars, 'wall of moms': Here's what's happening in Portland",07-20-2020 00:00,"Weeks of protests and the presence of federal authorities in Portland have brought the Oregon city into the national spotlight as tensions rise amid call for racial justice and changes to policing.

The city has seen nightly protests for nearly two months following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd was a Black man who died as a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck, and his death sparked a national movement and protests to address systemic racism.

In Portland, a city where protests are not uncommon, demonstrators and police have clashed for weeks with protesters lighting fires and law enforcement firing tear gas and other munitions.

Heightening tensions during the protest is the presence of federal law enforcement agents. Video shared on social media from last week showed what appear to be federal officers in unmarked cars arresting people without explanation, prompting outcry and lawsuits.

'Wall of moms':Group of mothers at Portland protest formed to protect demonstrators

Why are people protesting in Portland?

The increased unrest in Portland began in the days after Floyd's death. Cities across the United States saw clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement similar to those in Portland.

Activists have called for policies to challenge systemic racism, including to defund the police and reinvest the funds into other civil services like public housing and mental health support. Demonstrators have also decried the use of excess force by police, and law enforcement has responded to many protests by using force.

In Portland, video has shown both city police and federal law enforcement using tear gas or other munitions to disperse crowds.

According to the Oregonian, the city's police union has also drawn sharp criticism from protesters who say it hinders any possible changes to the department. On Saturday night, protesters set a fire at the Portland Police Association's building, but it was put out quickly.

On Sunday, a group of women formed what could be called a human shield, dubbed the ""wall of moms,"" at the front of a protest outside a federal courthouse. Videos on social media showed the group chanting, ""Moms are here, feds stay clear"" and ""Leave our kids alone.""

Protesters say federal police arrested them in unmarked cars

Federal agents were first seen in Portland on June 27, according to the Oregonian.

The newspaper reported that after protesters tore down a statue of George Washington in June, the city came under President Donald Trump's scrutiny. Trump mentioned the city at his Tulsa campaign rally, and the day after he signed an executive order on monuments, federal officers in camouflage were seen outside the federal courthouse, the Oregonian reported.

The presence of federal authorities in the city has ramped up ever since, and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf last Thursday during a visit to the city called the demonstrators ""violent anarchists.""

'Secret police force':Feds reportedly pull Portland protesters into unmarked vehicles, stirring outrage

The agents come from the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and an elite U.S. Customs and Border Protection team based on the U.S.-Mexico border and have been deployed to protect federal property.

Last week, video also surfaced of the federal authorities using unmarked vehicles to detain people, seemingly without an explanation.

Conner O’Shea, 30, a Portland resident who’s been attending protests for almost two months, told USA TODAY that early Thursday morning he and a friend were walking back to their car after leaving a protest when they were pursued by men they believed to be federal agents.

O’Shea said after being warned by other protesters that federal agents were driving around in unmarked vans ""snatching people,"" a van pulled over to the side walk and “four of five dudes in camo jump out and start charging at us.”

O’Shea did not see any sort of identifying markers on their camouflage uniforms. He said he got away, but his friend, Mark Pettibone, 29, was arrested and booked by federal agents.

In a statement Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that it detained a protester but disputed accounts that it did so without reason. The agency, which did not name Pettibone, said agents had information about a person suspected of assaulting federal agents or destroying federal property. The statement did not address the use of unmarked vans.

Federal authorities' use of less-lethal rounds has also drawn criticism. Donavan LaBella, 26, was critically injured and hospitalized after he was hit in the head by a less-lethal round fired by a federal officer on July 11.

Bystander videos show LaBella collapsing to the ground unconscious and bleeding profusely from the head. He was standing with both arms in the air holding a large speaker across the street from the courthouse when he was hit.

Portland mayor calls federal actions 'blatant abuse of police tactics'

Portland's mayor and state officials have repeatedly blasted the presence of federal law enforcement in the city and taken legal action.

On Sunday, Mayor Ted Wheeler said federal officers “are not wanted here. We haven’t asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave.”

“What we’re seeing is a blatant abuse of police tactics by the federal government,"" Wheeler, a Democrat, said Sunday.

Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit Friday against several federal agencies alleging agents in unmarked vehicles grabbed people off Portland's streets without a warrant.

The lawsuit says the agents violated the civil rights of Oregon residents by using unlawful tactics. It also asks the court to require federal agents to identify themselves and their agency before conducting an arrest and give an explanation to any person being detained for the arrest.

The U.S. Attorney in Portland, Billy Williams, also said Friday he had asked the Department of Homeland Security inspector general to investigate the incidents.

Wheeler also drew a distinction between the city's officers and federal authorities following LaBella's injuries.

""I want to make it very clear so that there’s no confusion,” Wheeler said earlier this month. “The serious injuries sustained by Donavan LaBella at the hands of a federal officer were unacceptable.”

However, Jo Ann Hardesty, one of the city's commissioners, was critical of Portland police's actions, saying its officers “joined in the aggressive clampdown of peaceful protest.” Hardesty, who oversees Portland's fire department and other first-responder agencies, said in an open letter to Wheeler if “you can’t control the police, give me the Portland Police Bureau.”

The Oregonian reported that Portland police have worked in tandem with the federal agents in the city to disperse protesters, despite some city officials insisting otherwise.

The newspaper reported that local officers have been seen marching shoulder-to-shoulder with federal authorities to clear streets.

“We do communicate with federal officers for the purpose of situational awareness and de-confliction,” Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell said at a Friday press conference, per the newspaper. “We’re operating in a very, very close proximity to one another, sometimes within the area of a city block.

The city's police do not take orders from federal agents nor vice versa, Lovell added.

Trump: We are trying to help Portland

On Sunday, Trump defended federal action in the city, saying, ""We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it.""

Trump also criticized the city's elected officials saying they had ""lost control"" and alleged that the protesters were ""anarchists and agitators"" and ""the real deal!""

Meanwhile, Ken Cuccinelli, Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary, dismissed the uproar over the use of unmarked vehicles in Portland, saying the practice is ""so common it's barely worth discussion.""

""Literally, every police department in America has them,"" Cuccinelli said on CNN's New Day on Monday.

Marcus Mariota & other Oregon legends approve of Civil War name change,07-14-2020 13:41,"Last month, Oregon and Oregon State issued a joint statement announcing that neither school will continue to refer to the Oregon-Oregon State rivalry game as the Civil War, due to associations with the American Civil War.

""Today’s announcement is not only right but is a long time coming, and I wish to thank former Duck great Dennis Dixon for raising the question and being the catalyst for change,"" said Oregon Director of Athletics Rob Mullens. ""Thanks also to our current student-athletes for their leadership and input during this process. We must all recognize the power of words and the symbolism associated with the Civil War. This mutual decision is in the best interests of both schools, and I would like to thank Scott Barnes for his diligence as we worked through this process. We look forward to our continued and fierce in-state rivalry with Oregon State in all sports.""

[RELATED]: Oregon-Oregon State no longer using ""Civil War"" name for its sports rivalry games

The reaction has been mixed. Many former players such as Dennis Dixon came out in support of the name change but others such as Tyson Coleman and Thomas Tyner, both Oregon natives, disagreed with the decision.

“Dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. It is the Civil War,” former Lake Oswego linebacker Tyson Coleman texted Tyson Alger of The Athletic. “Quote me.”

“Well, I’m right there with Tyson,” texted Thomas Tyner, an Aloha High School legend who played at both Oregon and Oregon State in college. “I think it’s nothing but stupid.”

However, of the athletes speaking about the decision, more tended to lean towards changing the name as a good idea.

Tuesday afternoon, Oregon Football tweeted out a video of former Ducks players voicing their approval of the name change.

Of those featured includes Heisman winner Marcus Mariota, Joey Harrington, Kenjon Barner, Jonathan Stewart, Geoff Schwartz, and Jeff Maehl.

""If my brother comes to me and says my words and my actions are hurting them, I first listen, and then I make a change,"" said Harrington.

""Regardless of the color of your skin, we are all in this together,"" added Stewart. ""All of us.""

Our brothers are speaking and we are listening. I support this change and our family should too. - Marcus Mariota

The players also all reiterated that ""the name is not the game,"" and saying that the rivalry will still be heated without the name.

""The game between the Ducks and the Beavers is one of the greatest rivalries in all of college football,"" said Maehl.

He will continue to believe that even without the name of the Civil War, both Universities want their fans to feel the same way.

Former Oregon Duck Joe Young drops “74-piece chicken nugget” in CBA game,07-14-2020 17:01,"What will college football look like when players finally hit the gridiron?

We already know that the Pac-12, as well as other conferences, have canceled all non-conference games, opting instead for a conference-only schedule to help eliminate travel.

But even with all the steps in place to help contain the spread of COVID-19, there is still risk in playing a full-contact sport like football.

Former Oregon Ducks lineman Geoff Schwartz raised a good question on the latest episode of the Talkin' Ducks podcast. ""Should we risk their health for playing football?""

[Listen and download for free ‘Sports Uncovered: The uniform craze that revolutionized college football].

Really, should we?

Is it worth the health of thousands of college athletes just to play a sport? Sure, leagues like the NBA and MLB are playing right now, but those players are professional athletes. They stand to lose millions of dollars if they don't take the field.

Whereas the amateurism of then NCAA means the athletes aren't making a dime, even if they play.

However, there are still millions of dollars on the line, and Schwartz knows it's the driving force behind a return to play.

""It's the money, right? It's the money. We know that 85% of all college football budgets are derived from football profits. That's why football is being pushed to play, otherwise, we have a catastrophic collapsing of athletic departments. So the question is, how much is that burden on the college athletes? - Geoff Schwartz on NCAA Football

The interesting part, however, is that teams are unlikely to return to stadiums with fans in the stands. If your 60,000 seat stadium has no one in it, then you are losing millions anyway. No ticket revenue. No concession revenue. No merchandise revenue.

Regardless of money gained or lost, health should be priority number one.

""I think we have to look at the data that's being presented to us as far as how COVID affects the individuals in the age range,"" said Schwartz. ""I do think there's still... incomplete data on the side effects of COVID. It's new. It's a novel coronavirus. It's still new to figure out.""

While the players will be on the ones playing the game, they won't be the only ones at risk. College coaches, many of whom are in the more at-risk age groups, will be on the field too.

That fact alone worries Schwartz the most.

""I'm worried less about players dying versus players having long-term health issues because they contract COVID,"" said Schwartz. ""The coaches are more in the age range where COVID can be more deadly, where it can really affect them, and where they can get really sick. So how much do we protect the coaches, basically, from themselves during the situation.""

So what will college football look like? We still don't know for sure. The Ducks are currently scheduled to start the season on September 26 against Colorado. There is still time to figure it all out, there's just not a lot of time to do it.

Update: Oklahoma State's Season Opener Against Oregon State Canceled,,"STILLWATER -- It's official, a little more than 24 hours after the Big Ten announced a conference-only schedule for the 2020 season, the Pac 12 has followed.

The Pac 12 announced on Friday that football, along with several other sports, would be playing a conference-only schedule for the fall of 2020, effectively canceling Oklahoma State's opener against Oregon State in Stillwater on Sept. 3.

Ironically, the commissioner of the Pac 12, Larry Scott, revealed shortly after the news from the conference that he has tested positive for COVID-19.

Oklahoma State is now going through the seismic shift the rest of college football embarked on earlier this week when the Ivy League became the first Division I (FCS) conference to make a move and cancel or postpone their football season until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The more influential move was made Thursday when the Big Ten announced that they would play conference games only, if they play any football games this fall.

The big picture question is now with two Power Five leagues going to conference games only, what will the Big 12 do? Hang on to this one for a few paragraphs.

The small picture question is what does that mean for Oklahoma State and the return game in the home and home series that started last season with the Cowboys visiting the Beavers in Corvallis?

Efforts to reach Oklahoma State deputy athletic director Chad Weiberg were unsuccessful. Weiberg had insisted, as had reports from media in Corvallis, Ore. that cover the Beavers program, that Oregon State had every intention of being in Stillwater if the game was going to be played.

Mike Gundy shakes hands with Jonathan Smith after the win over Oregon State in Corvallis to open last season, USA Today Sports Images - Troy Wayrynen

A high-ranking Oklahoma State athletic department official did tell Pokes Report that the contract with Oregon State has a clause for them to opt out of this season's game for unusual or extreme circumstances and make the game up in a later season. That is likely going to be the action taken now that the Pac 12 is no longer allowing members to play non conference games.

""It may be 15-years from now, but Oregon State will come and play in Stillwater,"" said our source.

As for the rest of the non conference season, the Tulsa game (Sept. 12) looks to be the most certain of the three. They are close by, have a long standing relationship with Oklahoma State and they are expected to monitor their team for coronavirus.

The other non conference game is with Western Illinois (Sept. 19). The problem presented there is how aggressively the FCS program will monitor and test their team for COVID-19. As of now, the Missouri Valley Football Conference and it's teams are planning on playing this season, although a number of Division II conferences have announced postponing football in the fall.

The Western Illinois game is one that Oklahoma State would have to examine closely with regards to concerns regarding the coronavirus.

If the Big 12 is playing non conference games, some options would be to look around at other regional schools that have lost a non conference game and match up. Or the Pokes could play Tulsa multiple times if their schedule allows it, or play another Big 12 team that loses a non conference game like TCU against Cal that first weekend and play it as a non conference game.

Tulsa is scheduled to host Toledo (Sept. 5), host Northwestern State (La) (Sept. 19), and travel to Arkansas State (Sept. 26). North Texas might be a good match for an opener as they are scheduled to host Houston Baptist on Sept. 5, but given conditions in Houston that game could be in question.

All of this leads to the big picture question and the Big 12 is not inclined to move right now on any action. Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby prefers to wait and see as most officials in college sports believed the deadline for firm decisions on the college football season is July 31.

When Randy Peterson of the Des Moines Register asked Bowlsby if the Big 12 planned to make a decision on the season soon, such as announcing conference games only, his one word answer was, ""No!.""

""We need to do what our doctors and our scientists are telling us, which is move slowly ahead and constantly reevaluate,"" Bowlsby told CBS Sports on Thursday. ""That is going to decide whether we're ready and able to play.""

The Big 12 athletic directors are said to favor playing non conference games and not limiting to conference games only.

""The only advantage to [a conference-only schedule] is you can spread the games out over more weeks,"" Bowlsby analyzed. ""It doesn't mean you're going to start your schedule the first week of October. You're going to try to start it on time and spread it out so you have more time to recover and more time to get over outbreaks. For whatever reason, the Big Ten felt like they wanted to go to it right now.""

The commissioner, who has athletic directors in his league in the quintet of Baylor's Mack Rhoades, Kansas State's Gene Taylor, Oklahoma's Joe Castiglione, TCU's Jeremiah Donati and West Virginia AD Shane Lyons; looking into protocols and contingencies for all types of scenarios and circumstances for this season is staying open to all possibilities. However, a conference-only schedule for the Big 12 was drawn up by that committee of athletic directors early in their process.

Medi-Cal mystery: Millions of enrollees haven’t materialized in California,07-24-2020 00:00,"By Rachel Bluth and Angela Hart | Kaiser Health News

The predictions were dire: Coronavirus lockdowns would put millions of Americans out of work, stripping them of their health insurance and pushing them into Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration projected that the pandemic would force about 2 million additional people to sign up for the state’s Medi-Cal program by July, raising enrollment to an all-time high of 14.5 million Californians — more than one-third of the state’s population.

But July is almost over, and Medi-Cal enrollment has hovered around 12.5 million since March, when the pandemic shut down much of the economy — though enrollment ticked up in May and June, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program.

Essentially, enrollment hasn’t budged even though nearly 3 million Californians are newly unemployed.

“It’s a mystery,” said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, an advocacy group for health consumers. “We have lots of plausible explanations, but they don’t seem to add up.”

Even the state is stumped. The enrollment data is preliminary, and Medi-Cal officials expect the numbers to grow as eligibility appeals and other “unusual cases” are resolved, but not by 2 million people, said Norman Williams, spokesperson for the Department of Health Care Services.

The department based its projections on the state’s experience with the Great Recession a decade ago, a comparison that it now acknowledges was misguided because the pandemic did not spur a purely economic crisis. The state failed to predict people would avoid care at clinics and hospitals during this public health crisis, and thus be less likely to need coverage immediately.

“The current situation is far more complex because it involves both economic and health decisions, creating a more complicated picture more closely related to that seen during the 1918 influenza pandemic,” Williams said in a prepared statement.

Even with the faulty comparison, it’s not clear why more Californians haven’t enrolled, he said.

“The state prepared an estimate based on the best data available, during an unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation,” he said.

The miscalculation meant the state likely allocated more money to Medi-Cal than the program now needs, even as lawmakers struggled to find ways to prevent deep health care cuts and close a massive $54 billion budget deficit as they negotiated the 2020-21 state budget in May and June.

And a more accurate estimate could have potentially funded new programs, such as expanding Medi-Cal to unauthorized immigrants age 65 and up, some state lawmakers and advocacy groups said.

Newsom backed that expansion of Medi-Cal, estimated to cost $80.5 million in the first year, in his January budget proposal but abandoned it in May, citing California’s financial crisis spurred by the pandemic.

“We are talking about life-or-death services, so to say I’m frustrated is putting it mildly,” said state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the Senate budget committee and leads budget negotiations in the upper house. “It’s irritating to me that they can be so off.”

The new state budget puts Medi-Cal’s overall cost at $115 billion, of which $2.4 billion in state money has been earmarked for caseload growth. Yet it’s unclear how much of that could have been available to fund other programs or stave off cuts had the caseload projection been more accurate, department officials acknowledged.

Most states predicted their Medicaid enrollment would rise due to the pandemic, though many are seeing similar delays in Medicaid sign-ups, said Cindy Mann, a partner at the legal and consulting firm Manatt Health who served as federal Medicaid director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the Obama administration.

Washington state, like California, hasn’t seen its Medicaid caseload grow as expected, said MaryAnne Lindeblad, its Medicaid director. It projected up to 95,000 people would join the program by now, yet it has seen 80,000 new enrollees since March.

“It’s been a little bit surprising,” she said. “There’s so much going on in people’s lives right now and signing up for Medicaid doesn’t seem to be one of them.”

Yet a record number of Americans have lost health insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic crash, according to a new report from Families USA, a national health advocacy group. California experienced the largest increase in newly uninsured residents of any state so far when an estimated 689,000 people lost coverage between February and May this year, the study shows.

“It’s a different kind of downturn and that might explain some of the reason we’re seeing lags across the country,” Mann said. “But unless unemployment numbers turn around dramatically, which is not the prediction, I think we will see the number of uninsured people continuing to grow and turn to the program.”

There are several theories about why Californians who have lost their jobs during the pandemic have not yet enrolled in Medi-Cal.

For one, signing up for food and housing assistance appears “more urgent” than signing up for Medi-Cal, Williams said.

The pandemic has also created new sign-up hurdles. With libraries, schools, community centers and county health care offices largely closed during lockdowns, uninsured residents have had fewer places to enroll. Hospitals and clinics also frequently enroll uninsured people into the program, but many healthy people are avoiding treatment for fear of being infected with COVID-19.

And those who have lost jobs may still have work-based coverage because employers planned to rehire them and kept them on job-based insurance plans, or because they’ve signed up for COBRA insurance temporarily.

Enrollment could also be lagging because the service industry has been hit hard, and many low-income workers in restaurants, bars or salons were already enrolled in Medi-Cal.

“About a quarter who were at risk of losing jobs were already enrolled when the crisis started,” said Laurel Lucia, director of health care programs at the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California-Berkeley.

Vanessa Poveda, 28, wasn’t among the service workers already enrolled in Medi-Cal when the crisis hit. Instead, she had health insurance through her job as a server at Bartlett Hall, an upscale gastropub near San Francisco’s Union Square.

When Poveda was laid off during the first round of coronavirus closures in March, the restaurant extended her health coverage for 30 days before it expired, she said. Now unemployed and uninsured, she thinks she probably qualifies for Medi-Cal but hasn’t signed up.

“I haven’t really gotten around to it,” she said.

Because Poveda is relatively healthy, she said, enrolling in coverage isn’t as urgent as some of her other needs.

“Medical insurance is definitely a top priority for me,” she said, “but I also need a roof over my head.”

In California, another factor may be at play. The Trump administration’s “public charge” policy may be having an outsize impact on Medi-Cal enrollment because of the state’s large immigrant population, said Hamutal Bernstein, a researcher at the Urban Institute. The rule allows federal immigration officials to more easily deny permanent residency status to those who depend on certain public benefits such as Medicaid.

“A lot of immigrant families are being disproportionately impacted by economic and health hardship and are increasingly needing some of this assistance,” Bernstein said. But “a lot of people are afraid of getting any kind of help.”

Federal rules also prevent the state from kicking anyone off Medicaid during the pandemic, which means people who normally would have fallen off the program will stay enrolled, contributing to the state’s inflated projections, Williams said.

The department said it is working to get out the word that Medi-Cal is available, but Mitchell is urging the state to do more.

“I’m concerned not enough outreach is being done,” she said. “We expect people to magically know they may qualify for Medi-Cal and they should go online and apply.”

Coronavirus updates: GOP senators consider $600 extension; US orders 100 million vaccine doses from Pfizer; California cases top NY,07-22-2020 00:00,"The U.S. government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses of a vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and a German firm, BioNTech, for $1.95 billion, the companies announced Wednesday.

The U.S. can acquire up to 500 million additional doses, the statement said.

Meanwhile, federal unemployment benefits are taking a hit at a time when more states are abruptly pausing their reopening plans. The $600 weekly jobless benefits bonus, approved in March, is about to expire and likely won't be extended or replaced before next month.

The U.S. has been averaging more than 60,000 new cases daily for multiple weeks, and hospitalizations have climbed to totals not seen in three months. A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Tuesday shows 10 states set seven-day records for new cases while five states had a record number of deaths over the period.

📈 Today's stats: The U.S. has more than 3.9 million cases and more than 141,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Globally, there have been almost 15 million cases and more than 615,000 deaths.

GOP senators consider short-term extension of extra $600

Senate Republicans are in talks with the Trump administration about temporarily extending the supplemental pay that millions of Americans receive on top of their weekly unemployment benefits.

The extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits, approved four months ago to help Americans deal with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, is set to expire at the end of the month.

Congressional leaders and the White House are in discussions about another broad coronavirus aid package but are unlikely to pass a new bill before the increased unemployment benefits expire.

A short-term extension of unemployment benefits is now on the table, although it’s unclear how long that extension would run and whether it would be for $600 or a lesser amount.

US hospitalizations back to peak levels as confirmed cases surge

More than 59,000 Americans are hospitalized with COVID-19 related illness, a return to the peak that rocked the nation in April, according data from the COVID Tracking Project. Hospitalizations have been steadily rising since hitting a low point of 27,772 on June 15. Several days with more than 59,000 were reported in April before the number began dropping steadily. But it has been rising for more than a month, according to the data.

Dr. Matthew G. Heinz is an internist in Arizona, which has struggled in recent weeks as the numbers rise. ""Hospitalizations and deaths due to the virus lag significantly behind reports of new infections,"" he said.

Pfizer hopes for approval of vaccine as soon as October

Pfizer and BioNTech announced a deal with the federal government for 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate once the companies obtain approval or emergency use authorization from U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Americans will receive the vaccine for free, the firms said. If the ongoing studies are successful, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be ready to seek Emergency Use Authorization or some form of regulatory approval as early as October.

The companies expect to manufacture globally up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The federal government, under Operation Warp Speed, has cut deals with multiple drug companies, trying to line up massive amounts of vaccines as soon as they become available.

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio by adding a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech increases the odds that we will have a safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

California surpasses New York with most confirmed cases in nation

California’s confirmed coronavirus cases surged to over 409,000, giving the state the dubious distinction of the most cases in the nation. Johns Hopkins University data shows California has about 1,200 more cases than New York, which was the global hot spot for the virus and related fatalities this spring. New York has 32,520 confirmed deaths; California’s about 8,000. California, with a population of 40 million, is about twice the size of New York. Scientists say reported coronavirus cases vastly underestimate the true number of infections because of the small number of tests.

If you're flying United, you already know you have to keep your mask on during your flight. Now, the airline says you also need to keep it on throughout the airport effective Friday. The company announced Wednesday, ahead of its quarterly earnings call, that customers are expected to don masks at United customer service counters and kiosks and United Club locations, plus at gates and baggage claim areas.

""We're really trying to close all the travel gaps,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box. A company statement warned that ""if customers refuse to comply, they may be refused travel and banned from flying United at least while the mask requirement is in place.""

CDC director Redfield 'absolutely' ready to send grandkids back to school

Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday he ""absolutely"" feels comfortable sending his own grandchildren back to schools this fall despite few gains in the pandemic struggle in the U.S. Redfield said failure to provide in-class education results in multiple public health issues as well as putting pressure on parents who need to return to work.

""It's really important to get out schools open,"" he told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" He said other than concerns about one grandchild who has cystic fibrosis, ""I'm 100% that they can get back to school.""

Florida governor: Schools should reopen, people shouldn't be afraid

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis urged Floridians Wednesday to “not let fear get the best of us and harm our children in the process,” reaffirming that school districts in the state should reopen in the fall.

The governor added that no parent will be ""forced"" to send their kids to school if they don't want to amid the coronavirus.""

“You can bet your bottom dollar that keeping schools closed” will increase the impact of the achievement gap, exacerbate depression and anxiety and limit kids’ opportunity to participate in sports, he said.

Florida’s Department of Health announced the state’s cases of COVID-19 had grown by 9,785 Wednesday, bringing the state’s known total to 379,619.

Pandemic 'super-profit' companies: And the rich get richer...

Amid the rash of bankruptcies and mass layoffs, some American companies are reaping ""dramatic profits"" during the pandemic, according to a new study by an international poverty-fighting group. An analysis published Wednesday by Oxfam, a Britain-based activist organization, found that 17 of the top 25 most profitable U.S. corporations, including Microsoft, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Facebook, Pfizer and Visa, are expected to make almost $85 billion more in 2020 in what it called ""super-profits"" than in previous years.

""Thanks to a combination of government assistance and pure luck, a handful of corporations are raking it in and making already rich shareholders even richer,"" said Irit Tamir, director of the private sector department at Oxfam America.

Phoning it in: Americans expect to be working, learning from home this fall

Most Americans expect their home to be a place of work and learning when the school year starts. More than 6 out of 10 Americans said it is likely they will be working from home this fall, according to The Harris Poll survey of 1,970 U.S. adults from July 18-19. And two-thirds of Americans said they expect their kids will be taking courses online from home. And bad news for the travel industry: 79% say it's unlikely they will travel on an airplane this fall, and 74% say they don't plan to stay in a hotel this fall, either.

Only 27% of parents say they expect to take their kids trick-or-treating, but they apparently will be wearing ""masks."" Support for wearing protective masks in public is up to 68% from 54% since late March.

Brazil President Bolsonaro still testing positive

Brazil’s government says President Jair Bolsonaro is still testing positive for the coronavirus following his July 7 announcement. The positive test Tuesday came after a follow-up check on July 15. The government says he remains in good health and that Bolsonaro will keep holding videoconferences instead of face-to-face meetings. He had to cancel a trip to northeastern Brazil. At least four members of Bolsonaro’s Cabinet have been diagnosed with COVID-19.

Many COVID-19 complaints falling on deaf ears in Supreme Court

The coronavirus pandemic has fueled an outbreak of lawsuits from voters, church worshipers, prisoners and others challenging public health policies, but the Supreme Court is proving to be a roadblock for those taking their complaints into courtrooms. Taken together, the high court's actions signal a desire to leave the pandemic in public officials' hands – an effort that may prove difficult as Election Day draws near.

“This is the most litigious year I’ve ever experienced on voting rights,"" said Dale Ho, director of the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed 15 lawsuits so far. “COVID has turbocharged these controversies and has created more emergencies around the country than we’ve ever had in an election year.”

'Perfect Pitch' star says she skipped a mask once – and got COVID-19

Actress Anna Camp, a co-star of the ""Pitch Perfect"" films, said she believes she contracted COVID-19 after not wearing her mask in public ""One. Time.""

Camp, who said she was ""extremely sick"" for three weeks, described her experience in an Instagram post in which she urged readers not to let their guard down. Camp lost her sense of taste and smell, with the smell only returning partially a month later. Other lingering symptoms, a month later, include dizziness, extreme fatigue, sinus problems, nausea, vomiting and fever, she said.

""I’m lucky. Because I didn’t die. But people are,"" Camp, 37, wrote. ""Please wear (your) mask. It can happen any time. And it can happen to anyone.""

State records fall as pandemic tightens grip on US

Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Puerto Rico set records for new cases over a seven-day period that ended Tuesday. A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data also revealed that a record numbers of deaths for a seven-day period were reported in Arizona, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The 581 deaths in Arizona was more than six times the number of deaths reported in any week in the state during the spring, the nation's death toll was hitting its peak.

Ex-CDC chief says more COVID-19 data should be released

States should release 15 categories of information deemed ""essential"" to understanding the pandemic, said Dr. Tom Frieden, now president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative designed to prevent epidemics and cardiovascular disease.

Vital information includes such data as a rolling average of new cases and deaths, hospitalizations per capita, testing turnaround time and percentage of people wearing masks. Only 40% of essential data points are being monitored and reported publicly, and half isn't made public at all, Frieden said.

""With clear guidance, we can understand our risk better and improve our response rapidly,"" Frieden said. ""This information was obtained with taxpayer dollars and we should demand that we have access to the information.""

Detroit schools expect student test results within 30 minutes

The superintendent of schools in Detroit said the district will comply with a judge's order to test the 600 in-classroom summer school students for COVID-19 by Monday. U.S. District Judge Arthur Tarnow ordered the testing to begin Wednesday. Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said the district has worked with the city of Detroit to obtain tests.

""We will allow parents who made the decision to send their children for face-to-face summer school instruction to have their children COVID-tested through nasal swabs,"" Vitti said. He added that the tests would be administered at the schools and results should be available within 30 minutes.

It was not immediately clear what impact the ruling would have on the new school year. The district tentatively plans to offer optional, in-classroom learning for the district's 50,000 students.

Some daycares welcoming toddlers – but don't forget the mask

President Donald Trump has pushed for a return to campus for older students, but the calculus is different with ages 2 to 4, an impressionable phase that leaves parents concerned about the possible impact of exposing children to a mask- and temperature check-filled setting from which parents now are excluded for health reasons. While protocols vary, many pre-K and day care facilities now have measures to keep teachers and children safe that include car drop-offs, fever checks and the wearing of masks or shields.

“We do see apprehension from parents,” says Jessica Chang, who co-founded WeeCare to help connect parents with some 2,500 child care facilities nationwide. “We offer virtual ways to interact with providers to raise their comfort level. And we encourage providers to make things fun when they can.”

Coronavirus updates: Mississippi hospitals running out of beds; unemployment up; US hits 4 million cases,07-23-2020 00:00,"As the United States surpassed 4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases Thursday, debate over the next stimulus bill heated up, with Republicans promising another round of $1,200 bonus checks and money for schools while Democrats dug in to protect the $600 weekly unemployment benefit bonus.

The bonus grew more relevant as the Labor Department reported 1.4 million people filed initial applications for benefits last week, the first weekly increase in four months. Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, said the numbers show that failing to extend the weekly bonus would be ""unconscionable.''

""Families will be evicted from their homes, poverty will soar, children will go hungry, businesses will shutter and the economy will tank,"" Stettner said.

Major League Baseball's opening day finally arrived, the virus-shortened season kicking off almost four months late and minus fans in the stands. The Washington Nationals, last year's World Series champs, were hosting the venerable New York Yankees. The equally venerable Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, tossed out the ceremonial first pitch.

Here are some significant developments:

📈 Today's stats: The U.S. surpassed 4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases Thursday. And the daily national death toll surpassed 1,000 for the second straight day and hospitalizations were again peaking. The Johns Hopkins University data dashboard reported 1,195 U.S. deaths Wednesday, high by standards of recent weeks but still only half of the daily toll during the outbreak's deadly peak in the spring. The Covid Tracking Project, however, showed almost 60,000 people are currently hospitalized, less than 200 short of the highest totals from April.

Marine assigned to Trump's helicopter unit tests positive for coronavirus

A Marine assigned to the military unit that flies Marine One tested positive for coronavirus but did not have direct contact with President Donald Trump or his presidential helicopter, the Marine Corps said Thursday.

""The Marine, who had been in Bedminster, New Jersey, prior to Trump’s travel there, did not have direct contact with Marine One, the president’s helicopter,"" the Marine Corps said in a statement.

""The Marine is asymptomatic. Contact tracing is being conducted with the White House, and Marines who may have had contact with the infected Marine have been removed from the unit,"" the statement read.

The aircraft in the presidential unit are being sanitized and Trump's weekend trip to his golf club in Bedminster on Friday is not expected to be affected.

'Wear a damn mask,' urges Mississippi hospital amid surge of patients

After repeatedly warning that hospitals in Mississippi are filling up, the leader of the University of Mississippi Medical Center took to Twitter Thursday with blunt language to tell residents what they can do to help slow the spread of the virus.

""Wear a damn mask. Wash your hands. It is not a big deal. It is not political. Just do it,"" reads a slide with UMMC branding tweeted by Dr. LouAnn Woodward.

The hospital is struggling to find beds for patients with all kinds of illnesses due to the surge, according to the slide.

On Friday, State Department of Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said eight major medical centers in Mississippi had no ICU beds. He said one patient had to be sent to an out-of-state hospital.

Trump cancels Jacksonville portion of Republican convention planned for August

President Donald Trump said Thursday he is cancelling the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention that had been planned next month because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""The timing for this event is not right,"" Trump said. ""There's nothing more important than keeping our people safe.""

Trump said that he would hold a speech of some kind to formally accept his party's nomination for president. The move is a significant blow to the campaign, which had hoped to use the convention to reset his presidential campaign.

US hits 4 million cases of COVID-19

The U.S. hit the latest bleak milestone Thursday in the historic and deadly pandemic: 4 million confirmed cases of infections.

And experts agree the number of cases is actually much greater — potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, almost 150,000 people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus as the nation continues to lead the world for most cases and deaths.

""We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in a Facebook Live interview July 6. ""And I would say, this would not be considered a wave. It was a surge, or a resurgence of infections superimposed upon a baseline.""

Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant dies after testing positive for COVID-19

A Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant died after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month in California, following an employee training at the airline's headquarters.

Hawaiian Airlines President & CEO Peter Ingram told employees in an internal memo distributed on Tuesday that Jeff Kurtzman, a senior Los Angeles-based flight attendant, died this week.

He had been a part of the airline since 1986, ""and over the past three decades had become well known to his in-flight colleagues for his passion for discovering new places, people and cultures; his terrific sense of humor and knack for easy conversation; and his caring heart,"" Ingram wrote in the memo, obtained by USA TODAY.

Hours before opening night, Nationals star Juan Soto tests positive for COVID-19

Major League Baseball’s prime-time return amid the COVID-19 pandemic was dealt an unsettling blow when one of its greatest young stars tested positive before he could take the field in 2020.

Juan Soto, the Washington Nationals’ dazzling 21-year-old outfielder, was omitted from the opening-day roster after a positive test for COVID-19, general manager Mike Rizzo confirmed Thursday, just hours before the defending World Series champions opened the season with a nationally-televised game against the New York Yankees.

Rizzo says Soto is asymptomatic after taking the test Tuesday and receiving the results Thursday morning, and says no other Nationals will be unavailable for the opener due to contact tracing ramifications.

GOP to reveal $1T stimulus plan; Dems back $600 weekly jobless bonus

Senate Republicans were scrambling Thursday to finalize a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package that will include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and additional funding to help schools recover from the pandemic.

GOP leaders and the White House said late Wednesday that they had agreed on key parts of the legislation, which will serve as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who have already passed their own bill in the House.

But Republicans are still struggling to put the finishing touches on the package. Congress and the White House are under pressure to clinch a deal on a fresh pandemic aid package; a federal program of expanded unemployment benefits is set to run out within days.

One item that will be missing from the GOP plan is President Donald Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut. Republicans abandoned that proposal even though Trump had suggested he might not sign any bill that doesn’t include it.

Iowa health officials draw scrutiny over meatpacking plant outbreak

The first confirmed coronavirus outbreak at an Iowa meatpacking plant was far more severe than previously known, with more than twice as many workers infected than the state Department of Public Health told the public, newly released records show.

The department said in May that 221 employees at the Tyson Foods pork processing plant in Columbus Junction tested positive. But days earlier, Tyson officials told Iowa workplace safety regulators that 522 plant employees had been infected, documents show. The discrepancy adds to mounting questions state officials face about public information during the pandemic.

Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said the number of infections announced by the state appeared to reflect only the first round of testing. “Coordinating facility-wide testing and obtaining results is a complex process that takes time,” he said.

Moms with COVID-19 can safely breastfeed newborns, study suggests

Mothers with COVID-19 may be able to stay in the same room with their newborns after birth and not transmit the virus if certain precautions are taken. Researchers observed 120 babies born to mothers with COVID-19 and found no cases of transmission during childbirth or after two weeks of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact, according to the small study published Thursday in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.

“We know that skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are important both for mother-infant bonding and for long-term child health,” said Dr. Patricia DeLaMora, who co-led the study from the Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian Komansky Children’s Hospital. “Our findings suggest that babies born to mothers with COVID-19 infection can still benefit from these safely.”

Parent company of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, shuttering 1,600 stores

The parent company of Lane Bryant, Ann Taylor and the Justice brand is the latest in a line of retail corporations battered by the pandemic to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. New Jersey-based Ascena Retail Group, which also operates Ann Taylor Loft, Catherines, Lou & Grey and Cacique, plans to ""reduce their store fleet from approximately 2,800 stores to approximately 1,200 stores,"" the company said in court records Thursday. The planned closures are a 56% ""reduction in the total store fleet.""

Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Sur La Table and J. Crew have all filed for Chapter 11 since May. As many as 25,000 stores could shutter this year as businesses continue to feel the impacts of the pandemic, according to a report from Coresight Research.

Middlemen banking billions off COVID-19 products

Middlemen seeking to profit from the pandemic have sprung up overnight to score billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 contracts, their stake as small as a mailbox rental or virtual office subscription. Some simply buy it from a manufacturer and resell it directly to the government at a steep markup. Global demand for personal protective equipment has attracted hundreds of construction, financing and technology companies to supplying health care products. One in 10 federal COVID-19 vendors are government contracting newcomers.

“It’s clearly opportunism,” said Benjamin Brunjes, an assistant professor at the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. “People are aware that there’s a huge amount of new money, and they’re taking a slice.”

'Cuomo Chips' won't cut it as a food order in New York bars

Sorry, bars and restaurants: You can't get around New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's food-with-alcohol order by offering a bag of ""Cuomo Chips"" or a few pieces of cheese. The State Liquor Authority updated its guidance to provide more clarity on Cuomo's order, which prevents bars and restaurants from serving alcoholic beverages to patrons who don't order food first. The order, issued last week, is meant to keep patrons in their seats and not congregating in groups around a bar or in an outdoor dining space. After bars began offering $1 chips and similar items as the food, the State Liquor Authority stepped in. Now the food must be ""sandwiches, soups or other foods, whether fresh, processed, precooked or frozen.""

USA TODAY panel of experts: We're almost halfway to an available vaccine

Propelled by encouraging results from early experiments, the clock has ticked forward one hour since June in USA TODAY’s countdown to a vaccine against COVID-19. For July, the hands sit at 5 a.m., our panel of experts estimates. Midnight is the starting point of the pandemic in the U.S., and noon is the time a vaccine will be widely available to Americans. The panel includes experts in medicine, virology, immunology, logistics and supply chain issues.

Florida, Texas among states with deadliest weeks

A USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Wednesday shows 12 states set records for new cases over a seven-day period while six states had a record number of deaths over the period. New case records were set in Alaska, California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Record numbers of deaths were reported in Florida, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

In Florida, the week's death toll was 824, more than twice the number of any week during the spring COVID-19 surge. Still, Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to press for in-classroom learning when schools open, some in less than three weeks. DeSantis stressed that young people face the least risk from the virus.

""It is our kids who have borne the harshest burden of the controlled measures instituted to protect against the virus,” DeSantis said Wednesday.

Remote learning gaining momentum as back-to-school season approaches

As COVID-19 cases rise in most states, the prospect of in-person learning this fall at the country's major school districts is becoming increasingly remote. Eleven of the top 15 school systems by enrollment are already planning to start the fall semester online or implement a hybrid of in-person and online classes, according to Education Week magazine's reopening tracker. In all, 11 of the 15 largest U.S. school systems are in communities adding COVID-19 cases at more than three times the rate they were in the two weeks ending May 1.

Among colleges, the Chronicle of Higher Education is tracking the reopening plans of more than 1,200 institutions. The findings: About half of universities plan to reopen, a third are proposing a mix of online and in-person classes, and 11% have committed to fully online learning.

1.4 million jobless claims filed, first increase since March

After slowly dropping for over four months, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims pushed higher last week, the Labor Department reported. More than 1.4 million Americans filed initial applications for unemployment insurance last week. That's far below the record 6.9 million who sought assistance in late March, but higher than the 1.3 million who filed claims the week before. The latest figure reverses the slow but steady slide that had occurred for 15 weeks in a row.

"California coronavirus cases top 400,000, soon to over take New York as worst-hit state",07-21-2020 18:54,"July 21 (Reuters) - California on Tuesday became the second U.S. state after New York to report more than 400,000 COVID-19 cases, according to a Reuters tally of county data.

The most populous U.S. state has totaled 400,166 COVID-19 cases, putting it on the verge of surpassing New York - the original epicenter of the nation’s outbreak - for the highest number of infections in the country since the novel coronavirus was first detected here in January.

At that point, if California were a country, it would rank fifth in the world for total COVID-19 cases behind only the United States, Brazil, India and Russia. New York currently has over 412,800 total cases and is adding on average 700 new cases a day in July while California is rising by an average of 8,300 cases a day.

Since its crush of cases earlier this year, New York state has gotten the virus under control, reporting the fewest hospitalizations in four months on Monday.

Last week, California’s Governor Gavin Newsom rolled back some of his reopening plans for the state by announcing the closure of some indoor venues that attract crowds such as bars, restaurants, movie theaters, zoos and museums. He also ordered gyms, churches and hair salons to close in the 30 hardest-hit counties of the state.

Newsom also released a controversial framework last Friday to reopen schools amid an intense debate across the United States about whether it would be safe to send children and teachers back into the classroom amid an ongoing pandemic.

Last week, the Rose Parade, an annual spectacle that has been held with few exceptions on New Year’s Day since 1890 in Pasadena, California, was canceled for 2021 due to the pandemic.

More than 141,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 - nearly a quarter of the global total - and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has forecast that the death toll could reach 157,000 by Aug. 8.

"California reports nearly 12,000 COVID cases, biggest increase since pandemic started",07-21-2020 10:48,"(Reuters) - California reported a record increase of more than 11,800 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, according to a Reuters tally of county data, as the Trump administration pushes for schools to reopen to help businesses return to normal.

If California were a country, it would be rank fifth in the world for total cases at nearly 400,000, behind the United States, Brazil, India and Russia.

This is the first time California has reported over 10,000 new infections since setting a record with 10,861 cases on July 14.

Florida has reported over 10,000 new cases a day for the last six days in a row and Texas has reported over 10,000 cases for five out of the last seven days.

California’s daily increases have already surpassed the highest daily tally reported by any European country during the height of the pandemic there.

The biggest outbreak in the state is in Los Angeles County, which has nearly 160,000 total cases on Monday. Hospitals are filling with COVID patients and Los Angeles reported record numbers of currently hospitalized coronavirus patients for the second day in a row on Monday.

To combat the pandemic, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is shutting down California again.

In addition to closing bars, he ordered restaurants, movie theaters, zoos and museums to cease indoor operations. Gyms, churches and hair salons must close in the 30 hardest-hit counties.

"Coronavirus update: Global case tally climbs to 15.6 million and U.S. hits 4.07 million as virus spreads fast in Florida, California and Texas",07-24-2020 00:00,"The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness COVID-19 climbed to 15.6 million on Friday, and the U.S. case tally hit 4.07 million as the virus continued to spread in the South and West and more states reported that health care systems are steadily being overwhelmed.

President Donald Trump canceled the planned Republican National Convention events that were due to take place in hot spot Florida next month, after that state saw a record number of fatalities in a single day on Thursday at 173. The U.S. counted more than 1,000 deaths on Thursday, with more than 500 of them taking place in Florida, California and Texas. The U.S. death toll is now 144,780, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University,

The U.S. added more than 69,900 cases on Thursday to push the total above 4 million, according to a New York Times tracker. The spread has accelerated through the summer, climbing to 4 million from 3 million in just 15 days, as the Washington Post reported. In the early days of the outbreak it took 45 days to increase from 1 million to 2 million cases, and then took 27 days to rise to 3 million.

Forty states have seen rising cases in the last 14 days, according to the Times tracker, led by Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told reporters at a briefing that his state is nearing breaking point after its case tally rose above 100,000.

Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Task Force created to manage the pandemic, took a more somber tone than usual on Friday on NBC’s “Today Show.”

“I just want to make it clear to the American public: What we have now are essentially three New Yorks, with these three major states,” she said. “And so we’re really having to respond as an American people, and that’s why you hear us calling for masks and increased social distancing to really stop the spread of this epidemic.”

The face mask issue continued to be a thorny issue with the American public with legal challenges against mandates extending to Oregon on Thursday, when conservative group Freedom Foundation filed a suit against Gov. Kate Brown.

“Governors in left-leaning states all over the country are making up the rules as they go – and ignoring the procedural rules their own state laws set up,” Jason Dudash, the Freedom Foundation’s Oregon director, said in a statement on the group’s website.

Last week, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over her face mask mandate. Several Georgia cities have also filed suits, while counties and districts in other states, including California, have also launched suits.

Public health experts have stressed that wearing face masks is key to containing the virus, along with frequent hand washing and social distancing. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, said at a recent news conference that if every American agreed to wear a mask, “over the next six weeks we could drive (the virus) into the ground.”

Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania, an oncologist, bioethicist and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, reiterated his concern that the U.S. has squandered the last four months, “and it really is very, very depressing,” he said in an interview on MSNBC.

“We’re really right back in March,” he said.

Latest tallies

The global death tally from COVID-19 stands at 634,954, the Johns Hopkins data shows, and at least 8.9 million people have recovered.

Brazil is second to the U.S. with 2.3 million cases and 84,082 deaths.

India is third measured by cases at 1.3 million, followed by Russia with 799,499 and South Africa with 408,052.

The U.K. has 299,500 cases and 45,762 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world.

China, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 86,177 cases and 4,650 fatalities.

What’s the economy saying?

There was good news on the housing front Friday, when data showed sales of new single-family homes rose sharply in June for the second straight month, pushing the sales rate to its highest level in 13 years, as MarketWatch’s Greg Robb reported.

The annual sales pace for U.S. new-home sales rose 13.8% last month to 776,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. That’s above the prior cycle high of 774,000 hit in January and is the strongest since July 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a June sales rate of 710,000, compared with an original May estimate of 676,000. On Friday, the government revised May’s rate to 682,000. That pushed the May rise in new home sales to 19.4%

“The impact of falling mortgage rates — down 80 basis points this year — is more than offsetting the wave of Covid-induced job losses, which seem to be hitting younger renters rather than would-be homebuyers; the median buyer is 47 years of age, while the median restaurant employee is 29,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

A separate report found the service sector lagging behind manufacturing, as some areas of the country have reimposed lockdown measures.

IHS Markit said its U.S. flash manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.3 in July from 49.8 in the previous month. The flash services purchasing managers index rose only to 49.6 from 47.9 in June.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates improving conditions, while readings below that measure indicate contraction. The flash estimate is typically based on approximately 85%–90% of total survey responses each month.

The U.S. economy is experiencing the first-ever recession driven by the services sector. And economists are concerned because some key service sectors like travel, restaurants, and entertainment are not expected to recover soon given the pandemic. Manufacturing is slowly getting on its feet but is still experiencing headwinds.

“The lack of growth is a disappointment,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

What are companies saying?

Three Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA components reported earnings, starting late Thursday with chip giant Intel Corp., which disappointed with news of a delay in its next generation of semiconductor technology, MarketWatch’s Jon Swartz reported. Intel said it may actually use a third party to manufacture it as a contingency plan.

Intel US:INTC stock was slammed after it reported along with second-quarter earnings that the introduction of its 7-nanometer chips would be delayed by at least six months. AMD US:AMD is already selling 7-nm semiconductors for servers and PCs; in chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, is the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power.

“We have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation,” said Bob Swan, Intel’s chief executive, on a conference call late Thursday. “We’ve root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty.”

There was better news from American Express Co. US:AXP, which posted a surprise profit for the second quarter, but revenue that lagged estimates amid a fall in card member spending during the pandemic.

Verizon Communications US:VZ beat on profit and revenue but its report showed negative impacts from the pandemic. The wireless operator estimates that both GAAP and adjusted EPS saw negative impacts of about 14 cents stemming from impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenue for Verizon’s media unit.

Elsewhere, there was a setback for Moderna Inc. US:MRNA, one of the many companies working on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. US:ABUS in a patent dispute between the companies, MarketWatch’s Jaimy Lee reported.

The decision may mean that Arbutus will attempt to make a royalty claim to products developed by Moderna’s lipid nanoparticle delivery technology, which is currently being used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

SVB Leerink’s Mani Foroohar said the ruling is a “disappointing turn” for Moderna, and “any meaningful royalty burden could hamper MRNA’s pricing flexibility and margin profile vs. other players in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine market.”

What It Would Take to Reach Herd Immunity for the Coronavirus

Here’s the latest news on companies and COVID-19:

• Fans of the iPhone will probably have to wait at least another month before shiny new models are unveiled. Apple Inc. US:AAPL is delaying its annual fall event until the latter half of October instead of early September, according to a tech blog. The company was forced to push back the event for the 5G-compatible iPhone 12 line because of production delays caused by the pandemic, the Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara reported. Apple is expected to announce four new iPhones, with the 5G models available in November.

• Boston Beer Co. US:SAM, maker of Sam Adams and other alcoholic beverages, reported an unexpected doubling of profit from the year before amid the pandemic. Chief Executive Dave Burwick credited “increases in our Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands and the addition of the Dogfish Head brands” for some of the demand gains. Boston Beer now expects full-year earnings of $11.70 to $12.70 a share, while analysts on average had forecast 2020 earnings of $9.84 a share.

• eHealth Inc. US:EHTH, an online health insurance marketplace, reported an adjusted quarterly profit and sales that came in above expectations. Revenue rose 35% to $88.8 million. The company said the number of new paying members for all its Medicare products rose 40% to 72,651 people. •

• ETrade Financial Corp. US:ETFC reported fiscal second-quarter results that slightly exceeded Wall Street estimates. The company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents a share.

• Honeywell International Inc. US:HON reported second-quarter profit and sales that fell, but beat expectations. The company said it expects sales challenges resulting from the pandemic will continue, particularly in the aerospace and oil and gas businesses. Aerospace sales declined 28% to $2.54 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $2.41 billion; performance materials and technologies sales declined 19% to $2.22 billion but topped expectations of $2.19 billion; safety and productivity sales slipped 1% to $1.54 billion to beat expectations of $1.43 billion; and building technologies sales shed 19% to $1.18 billion, missing expectations of $1.24 billion.

• Toy maker Mattel Inc. US:MAT reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss and sales that were higher than Wall Street expected, thanks to sales in North America and total sales of Barbie and other dolls and games. Online sales “continued to grow strongly in all regions.” Gross sales in North America increased 3%, primarily on sales of Barbies as well as action figures, building sets, and games, the company said. Sales of its toy vehicles, including Hot Wheels, fell, the company said. Mattel said its supply chain continued to perform well despite temporary closures connected to the coronavirus pandemic. “Currently all of our factories are open with minimal disruption to operations, as we enter the peak production season,” it said. Liquidity is expected to be enough “to effectively manage through the COVID-19 disruption and to continue to execute our strategy,” the company said.

• Paramount Pictures will delay the release of two of its most anticipated movies, “Top Gun: Maverick,” and “A Quiet Place Part II,” to 2021 due to the pandemic. The “Quiet Place” sequel is now scheduled for April 23, 2021, and the “Top Gun” sequel is on tap for July 2, 2021. Paramount is a unit of ViacomCBS Inc. US:VIAC

• ScanSource Inc. US:SCSC, a provider of barcode, networking, security and business communications services, provided an upbeat sales outlook, while also saying it will cut jobs as part of a expense-reduction plan. The company expects fiscal fourth-quarter net sales of $758 million, compared with the FactSet consensus for total revenue of $718 million. ScanSource announced a $30 million cost cutting plan, which will include a reduction of its North America workforce, salary reductions of 10% to 25% for its executive team, elimination of cash retainers for the board of directors for the rest of the year and cutting discretionary spending. The company is closing its Canpango professional services business, which it acquired in August 2018, which is expected to result in a $2 million charge.

• Schlumberger Ltd. US:SLB swung to a multibillion-dollar loss in the second quarter and revenue fell short of estimates, as the twin effects of the pandemic and falling oil price weighed. “This has probably been the most challenging quarter in past decades,” Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said, as he announced 21,000 job cuts. Revenue fell 28% from the first quarter, “caused by the unprecedented fall in North America activity, and international activity drop due to downward revisions to customer budgets accentuated by COVID-19 disruptions. This speaks volumes about an industry confronted with historic oil demand and supply imbalances caused by demand destruction from the global COVID-19 containment effort.” The company is reorganizing and combining its 17 product lines into four divisions, restructuring geographically around five key basins of activity and streamlining management, he said. Schlumberger expects to remove $1.5 billion of costs permanently. “Looking at the macro view in the near-term, oil demand is slowly starting to normalize and is expected to improve as government measures support consumption,” said the CEO. “However, subsequent waves of potential COVID-19 resurgence pose a negative risk to this outlook.”

• Skechers USA Inc. US:SKX reported a narrower-than-expected adjusted second-quarter loss and sales that were above expectations. “Skechers, like most businesses around the world, has never faced a more challenging time than during the pandemic, which caused the closing of nearly every market worldwide,” Chief Executive Robert Greenberg said. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents around $1.6 billion, thanks in part to drawing down $490 million from its credit facility in the first quarter. The company did not provide an outlook.

• Office supply equipment retailer Staples became the latest to require face coverings in all its stores starting Monday. Staples is an essential retailer, selling hand sanitizer and other personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as equipment for working and schooling from home. Staples joins retailers like Walmart Inc. US:WMT and Target Corp. US:TGT that will require customers to wear face coverings in stores.

The live-action movie has been repeatedly delayed. Additionally, Disney delayed releases of Star Wars and Avatar movies by a year. “Over the last few months, it’s become clear that nothing can be set in stone when it comes to how we release films during this global health crisis, and today that means pausing our release plans for ‘Mulan’ as we assess how we can most effectively bring this film to audiences around the world,” a Walt Disney Studios spokesperson said in a statement.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-update-global-case-tally-tops-155-million-and-us-hits-405-million-as-virus-spreads-fast-in-florida-california-and-texas-2020-07-24?mod=hp_minor_pos20,9,California,USA,"""California"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",

"California Gov. Newsom orders statewide closures, including indoor restaurant operations",07-13-2020 00:00,"PALM SPRINGS, Calif. – California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday a list of business sectors that will be required to close as the number of coronavirus cases continue to increase substantially across the state.

California's average daily new cases hit 8,211 over the past week and 23 people died because of virus-related complications in the past 24 hours.

All counties are required to close indoor operations of restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums, card rooms and all bars.

The 30 counties that are on the state’s targeted engagement list are ordered to close additional businesses. The targeted counties, which account for 80% of the state’s population, are also required to close indoor operations of fitness centers, places of worship, offices for noncritical sectors, personal hair services, and indoor malls.

The state's engagement list details counties that are struggling to contain the spread of the virus. A week ago, just 23 counties were on this list. Placer, Sonoma, Sutter and Yuba counties were added to the list today.

Newsom expects two additional counties to be added in the coming days.

Surging ICU usage prompts re-closures

As intensive care bed usage continues to surge across the state – ICU capacity in Riverside County hit 100% on Friday – Newsom says his actions will become more aggressive.

About 36% of the states total ICU beds remain available. In Placer, Lake and Butte counties, less than 20% of ICU beds are available, Newsom says.

Coronavirus:California may release 10% of inmates in pandemic response

""This continues to be a deadly disease,"" he said on Monday. ""This continues to be a disease that puts people in our ICUs, in our hospitals and is currently putting a strain on our hospital system. ... We're starting to see in some rural parts of the state an increase in ICU use that is generating some concern.""

Across the state, COVID-19 hospitalizations increased 28% over a two-week period, which is better than the 50% increase presented about a week ago. However, officials expect to see another surge in cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks because of the July 4 holiday.

""When you start to see ... constraint in terms of ICU beds an additional increase in use and utilization in ventilators it then draws our attention. The data then bears a consequence. The consequence being the data driving the decision to utilize that dimmer switch,"" Newsom said.

How did California get here?

This ""dimming"" of the economy, as Newsom refers to the closures, comes after his administration allowed counties to reopen before they were prepared.

Of the 49 counties that were allowed to follow a quicker path in mid-May, 49% failed to meet at least one of the reopening criteria mandated by the state, according to an analysis by The Palm Springs Desert Sun of the USA TODAY Network.

At that time, nearly a third of the counties that received the green light didn’t have enough contact tracers, and more than 20% were failing to conduct enough coronavirus tests on a daily basis.

Newsom on Monday acknowledged that testing in California is currently ""inadequate"" to meet the needs of the state. He said it is ""unacceptable"" that the state is not able to do more widespread testing. Just last week, San Bernardino County canceled 11,000 coronavirus tests because of a supply shortage.

Counties began to show signs of struggle in June, as cases began increasing as a result of the reopening. Newsom said if counties didn't shape up, the state would step in, and gave a two-week deadline from the date they were initially placed on the targeted engagement list.

However, eight counties ⁠– home to 35% of the state’s population ⁠– were allowed to blow past that deadline, according to a Desert Sun analysis, and the state took no concrete action.

It wasn't until early July that the state took action, threatening to withhold funding from counties and closing bars ahead of the Fourth of July weekend in counties on the watch list.

Now, Newsom says he plans to use the ""dimmer switch ... a little bit more forcefully.""

The governor acknowledged that the state was able to control the spread of the virus following the initial sweeping stay-at-home orders.

""We were able to suppress the spread of this virus, we were able to knock down the growth of this in the beginning. We are going to do that again, there is no doubt in my mind,"" he said.

High school football in California won't begin until December or January due to COVID-19,07-20-2020 18:59,"High school football in the state of California will not begin until December at the earliest.

The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) announced Monday that the sports season for the upcoming school year will begin with a modified schedule, beginning in December 2020 or January 2021. The unprecedented alteration is due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The CIF, which is divided into 10 sections throughout the state, said each individual section will determine their own calendar “to reflect regular season starting and ending dates,” as well as playoffs.

“It is anticipated that most Section start dates will commence in December 2020 or January 2021,” the CIF said in a statement.

Due to a recent surge in coronavirus cases, most California schools are planning to start the upcoming academic year by offering only online classes. According to the Los Angeles Times, high school football practices were scheduled to begin Aug. 3 with games to follow beginning Aug. 21. Now, after Monday’s news, practices won’t begin until December with the season likely extending into mid-April.

“We are continuously monitoring the directives and guidelines released from the Governor's Office, the California Department of Education, the California Department of Public Health, and local county health departments and agencies as these directives and guidelines are followed by our member schools/school districts with student health and safety at the forefront,” the CIF said.

Florida moving forward despite spike

While California is halting sports this fall, Florida seems to be pushing right ahead.

The Florida High School Athletic Association board of directors voted to keep its fall sports schedule intact after a lengthy meeting on Monday, according to the Florida Times-Union.

Fall sports in the state will start next Monday, though schools are not required to start by that date.

There were more than 3.8 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States as of Monday night, according to The New York Times, and more than 140,000 deaths attributed to it. The country set a new single-day record on Thursday, recording more than 75,000 new cases alone.

Florida had more than 360,000 confirmed cases, the third-most in the country behind only New York and California, and set a stunning new state record earlier this month with more than 15,000 new cases in a single day. The state is averaging more than 11,000 new cases a day over the past week.

“A lot of this may be moot because we may get shut down again,” Wewahitchka athletic director Bobby Johns said, via the Times-Union.

Other states to follow?

According to USA Today, high school football in the fall has already been canceled in Virginia, New Mexico and Washington D.C. Additionally, 11 states other than California to move to delay the season are Arizona, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.

Football hotbeds like Texas and Florida are still moving forward toward a season, though decisions from both states could be coming.

In Texas, officials of the University Interscholastic League, which oversees high school sports in the state, is also expected to make a Monday announcement.

The U.S. reported third-highest number of daily coronavirus cases ever and the highest since late April

— The U.S. reported more than 35,000 new coronavirus cases yesterday, according to The New York Times. That's the third-highest number of new daily cases the country has reported yet and the highest since late April, according to the Times. Cities and states across the U.S. are suspending reopening plans as cases begin to spike, according to The New York Times. North Carolina paused reopening such that it will remain in phase 2 for three more weeks, according to a statement from the North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. He also required face coverings in public places.

“North Carolina is relying on the data and the science to lift restrictions responsibly, and right now our increasing numbers show we need to hit the pause button while we work to stabilize our trends,” Cooper said. “We need to all work together so we can protect our families and neighbors, restore our economy, and get people back to work and our children back to school.”

Meanwhile, Texas reported 5,489 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, a record number of daily coronavirus cases for the state and ICU beds in Houston reached 97% of normal capacity, according to The Guardian. “We want to make sure that everyone reinforces the best safe practices of wearing a mask, hand sanitization, maintaining safe distance, but importantly, because the spread is so rampant right now, there’s never a reason for you to have to leave your home,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott told local news station KBTX-TV on Tuesday, according to The Guardian. “Unless you do need to go out, the safest place for you is at your home.”

— Beginning tonight at midnight, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut will require that people traveling from hotspot states quarantine for 14 days, according to CNN.

Currently, this travel advisory is for people coming from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas. Each of the three states will be responsible for enforcing this quarantine. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said this travel advisory was voluntary but ""urgent guidance,"" while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said violations would lead to a judicial order and mandatory quarantine. In New York, fines are $2,000 for the first violation, $5,000 for the second and $10,000 if harm is caused, according to CNN. When it comes to fines, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the health commissioner ""has within her powers to directly address an individual who is non-compliant,"" according to CNN.

— Wearing masks and social distancing needs to be normalized before a possible second wave hits, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University said today on “CNN Newsroom.” Politicians, religious leaders and businesses should be modeling this behavior, he said, according to CNN.""The time to normalize wearing masks and social distancing behavior is now, so that we get used to it by the time the fall arrives,” he said. “And I'm very concerned that the second wave this fall will be substantially greater than what we have experienced so far.”

CDC updates its list of preexisting conditions that increase and might increase the risk of severe COVID-19

— The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its list of preexisting conditions that increase and might increase the risk for severe COVID-19, the agency announced today. According to the CDC, people of any age who have chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; have an immunocompromised state from a solid organ transplant; are obese; have serious heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies; have sickle cell disease; or have type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. People might be at an increased risk from severe illness if they have moderate to severe asthma; cerebrovascular disease; cystic fibrosis; hypertension or high blood pressure; are immunocompromised from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids or use of other immune weakening medicines; have neurological conditions such as dementia; have liver disease; are pregnant; have pulmonary fibrosis; smoke; have a type of blood disorder called thalassemia; or have type 1 diabetes mellitus, according to the CDC.

— New York City is on track to enter phase 3 of reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today, according to The New York Times. This phase would allow outdoor recreational spaces to open again along with indoor dining and personal-care services such as manicures, tattooing and waxing to start up again with social distancing, according to the Times.

— Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York are all on track to contain COVID-19, according to a model created by the non-profit Covid Act Now, CBS Boston reported. The four indicators that the model uses to assess how at risk a state is of COVID-19 is: Are COVID cases decreasing? Are we testing enough? Are our hospitals ready? Are we tracing fast enough (i.e. finding and isolating new cases before the virus spreads)? While those four states are ""on track to contain covid-19,"" the rest of the states have a higher covid risk either having an ""active or imminent outbreak"" to being ""at risk"" of an outbreak to having ""controlled disease growth.""

Texas suspends reopening, CDC director says the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. is likely 10 times higher than official count

— Texas is pausing reopening, Gov. Greg Abbott said today, according to CNBC. However, businesses that were already allowed to reopen can continue to stay open at designated occupancies, according to a statement from the Texas Department of State Health Services, CNBC reported. For example, restaurants, gyms, retailers, professional sports, bars and other venues were allowed to reopen with a limited capacity in May, according to CNBC. “The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business,” Abbott said.

— The number of people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus is likely 10 times higher than the current confirmed number of cases, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield said today. “Our best estimate right now is that for every case that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,"" he said, The Washington Post reported. There are currently 2.3 million confirmed cases in the U.S., so if this is the case, there would be at least 23 million cases across the country, according to the Post.

New Delhi plans to test all of its residents for the coronavirus, Texas, Florida and Arizona pause reopening plans amid alarming rise in cases

— As India’s coronavirus case counts nearly reaches 500,000, officials in New Delhi are planning to test all 29 million of its residents for the coronavirus across a span of 10 days, according to The New York Times.

Texas and Florida shut down on-site consumption of alcohol at bars amid record-breaking number of coronavirus cases

— 16 NBA players out of 302 total tested positive for the coronavirus, The National Basketball Players Association announced today. Any player who tests positive will remain in self-isolation until satisfying public health protocols to stop isolation and being cleared by a physician, according to the statement. The NBA is set to restart on July 30 in Orlando, Florida and players who participate in voluntary workouts will be tested every other day starting next week, according to Axios.

— Amid a surge in cases, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott said all bars are required to close by noon on Friday, though they can still offer delivery and takeout (including alcoholic beverages), according to his executive order. Restaurants can remain open for dining inside at 50% indoor capacity, rafting and tubing businesses must close and most outdoor gatherings of 100 or more people must be approved by local governments, according to his order. Texas recorded 5,996 cases on Thursday, a record-number, according to the Texas Tribune. The state also reported a record number of hospitalizations: 4,739, according to the Tribune.

“At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars. The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and enhance public health. We want this to be as limited in duration as possible. However, we can only slow the spread if everyone in Texas does their part,"" Abbott said in the order. ""Every Texan has a responsibility to themselves and their loved ones to wear a mask, wash their hands, stay six feet apart from others in public, and stay home if they can.""

— Today, Florida reported 8,942 new COVID-19 cases, a record number of cases, smashing the previous record of 5,508 on Wednesday, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Florida shut down on-site alcohol consumption at bars ""effective immediately,"" Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears tweeted around 11 am.

— The U.S. may start conducting ""pooled testing"" as COVID-19 spreads, according to a new Live Science report. To improve the tracking of the coronavirus spread, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might approve broader use of ""pooled testing"" which would mean that diagnostic tests can be processed in batches (tests from five to 10 people could be tested together) rather than one at a time, according to the report. If the pooled sample comes back negative, no additional testing is needed for the people in the group but if it comes back positive, samples must be retested one by one to pinpoint who was infected, according to the report. But this approach would likely only work if just a small proportion of the population is infected because if too many people were infected, then too many pooled samples would test positive and require further testing, meaning that pooled testing wouldn't lead to a net decrease in total tests required, according to the report.

— Yesterday, the U.S. recorded 40,184 new coronavirus cases, a record number of cases, according to another Live Science report. Some states are doing better than others. There are several indicators that can help determine whether a state or county is moving in the right direction or not, including test positivity rate which means the proportion of tests that turn up positive for COVID-19; daily number of hospitalizations which can reveal whether an area has the virus under controllable levels or not; burden on hospital systems to see if hospitals have the capacity to treat severe COVID-19 infections; and contact tracing which means how well an area is finding and isolating people infected with the coronavirus, according to the report.

— Recently, the U.S., especially Florida, Texas and Arizona, has seen a marked increase in coronavirus cases among people under the age of 40, according to The Guardian. Though most prominently seen in the U.S., similar trends have been found recently in Israel and Portugal. Some are guessing that the younger age groups have evolved relaxed attitudes toward social distancing thinking that they are less likely to have severe disease (young people can still have severe disease), according to the Guardian. Others have said that this is due to better and more extensive testing that has been finding more mild cases— that might be attributed to younger people— than in the beginning of the pandemic, according to The Guardian.

World nears 10 million cases, Egypt loosens lockdown, U.S. rolls back reopening

—Worldwide, COVID-19 infections have reached more than 9.8 million with 494,857 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard. The top countries have logged the following:

-U.S.: Nearly 2.5 million cases and 125,039 deaths

-India: 508,953 cases and 15,685 deaths

-U.K.: 310,837 cases and 43,498 deaths

—Despite a continued uptick in COVID-19 cases, Egypt loosened many of its lockdown measures today. After being closed for more than three months, cafes, clubs, gyms and theaters have reopened, The Guardian reported. Mosques and churches also reopened. However, they aren't opened completely: Restaurants are allowed 25% seating capacity, and mosques and churches aren't allowed to hold the main weekly services, as those draw large crowds, The Guardian reported. To date, Egypt has recorded 62,755 cases and 2,620 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.

—Several U.S. states showing spikes in cases have rolled back reopening plans, with some posing more restrictions. For instance, in Texas and Florida, leaders have done a turnabout and set new restrictions on bars, The New York Times reported. ""If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars,"" Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said in an interview with KVIA-TV in El Paso on Friday (June 26), the Times reported. In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the mayor said he would close beaches from July 3 — July 7 ahead of any mass gatherings planned for the July Fourth weekend, the Times said. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has placed new restrictions on Imperial County, which borders Arizona and the Mexican state of Baja California and has the highest infection rate in the state, the Times reported.

10x more infections than reported, 5% of NBA players test positive, Florida smashes more records

—There are 10 times more COVID-19 infections in some parts of the U.S. than being reported, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The New York Times reported. For instance, as of April 12, the prevalence of COVID-19 in South Florida was at just 1.85%, according to the CDC. That prevalence, however, is likely higher because of the current surge in infections, the Times said. The highest prevalence, of 6.93%, was found in the New York City as of April 1. ""This study underscores that there are probably a lot of people infected without knowing it, likely because they have mild or asymptomatic infection,"" said study leader Dr. Fiona Havers, the Times reported. ""But those people could still spread it to others."" In addition, the study highlights the fact that even in the hardest-hit regions, the majority of people have yet to be infected.

—This week, 5% of NBA players tested positive for COVID-19, or 16 out of 302 players who were tested, the Wall Street Journal reported. Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, said that none of the players was seriously sick and that the NBA had anticipated this rate of infection. The basketball players will begin to move into a Walt Disney World campus, as the WSJ called it, on July 7, ahead of a July 30 start to the season. Any player who tests positive will quarantine until he meets certain guidelines and has been cleared by a doctor, the WSJ said. The NBA shut down on March 11, after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus.

—Florida smashed records for new cases again Saturday (June 27), with 9,585 new COVID-19 cases, The Washington Post reported. The state's previous record was hit just yesterday, with 8,942 new cases. Even as Florida's virus numbers soar, Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted a push to make face coverings mandatory across the state. Even so, some areas such as Palm Beach County and cities in Miami-Dade County have announced their own requirements for face masks in public, the Post said.

18 Texans test positive after attending surprise birthday party

Eighteen people who attended a surprise birthday party in North Texas have tested positive for COVID-19. The party, attended by 25 people and lasting just a few hours, has left one man's father fighting for his life in the ICU, Miami news station WSVN-TV reported.

""When people started getting sick, we really let everyone have it,"" Ron Barbosa, whose father is in the ICU, told WFAA-TV, as reported by WSVN-TV. ""We knew this was going to happen, I mean, this whole time this has been going on we've been terrified.""

Barbosa didn't attend the May 30 party for his daughter-in-law because he was concerned about COVID-19 transmission. Barbosa's mother, who just swung by the party to drop off something, also tested positive for the virus and had to be admitted to the hospital. Both of Barbosa's parents are in their 80s. His sister, who is battling breast cancer, also contracted the virus and has been hospitalized, WFAA-TV reported.

Apparently at the time, the partygoers were following the state's guidelines for lowering the risk of COVID-19, the news outlet reported. Amid a surge in cases and hospitalizations in the state, Gov. Greg Abbott halted the reopening of the state on Friday (June 26) and also rolled back some allowances — closing all bars again, for instance.

Yesterday, Texas recorded 6,079 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the state's total to 148,845, with 2,406 related deaths. The state's positivity rate — the percentage of tests turning out positive — is continuing an alarming rise and is now at about 13.7% (on a 7-day rolling average). An increasing positivity rate is a sign that transmission in your area is also increasing.

World surpasses 500,000 deaths, as US shows alarming surge in cases

The world has surpassed another grim milestone: 10 million cases of COVID-19, with related deaths reaching more than a half-million, according to Worldometer and the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard. The global death toll from the virus had just passed 100,000 in April, just a month after the World Health Organization had declared a COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times reported. That death toll more than doubled, reaching 250,000 in early May. And now in under two months, the number has doubled again.

About 25% of those deaths or 128,433 occurred in the United States, with about 8% of the known deaths or 57,658 being reported in Brazil. The United Kingdom has also confirmed an alarming death toll, at 43,550 deaths related to COVID-19, according to Worldometer.

The U.S. in particular is showing worrisome signs in certain states. Across the country, COVID-19 cases have risen 65 percent over the past two weeks, the Times reported. On Saturday (June 27) alone, more than 43,000 cases were confirmed in the U.S., according to Worldometer. Florida, Nevada and South Carolina broke single-day records for most new cases, the Times said.

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott warned that the virus in the state had taken a ""very swift and a very dangerous turn,"" the Times reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited the state today, donning a face mask; he stressed the importance of wearing masks.

Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, also urged Texans to put on face masks and avoid close contact with others, the Times said. ""I'm really appealing to every Texan to wear a mask,"" Birx said on Sunday. ""I'm just here really to ask every one of them to wear masks, every single one of them to wear a mask.""

'Window is closing' for the U.S. to get the pandemic under control, Alex Azar said on Sunday

— The ""window is closing"" for the U.S. to get the pandemic under control, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Things are very different from two months ago... So it is a very different situation, but this is a very, very serious situation and the window is closing for us to take action and get this under control,"" he said, according to CNN. Still, he said, the U.S. is in a better place to fight the pandemic, because of increased testing, contact tracing, hospital capacity, reserves of personal protective equipment and advances toward drugs and vaccines. If Americans ""act irresponsibly, if we don't socially distance, if we don't use face coverings in settings where we can't social distance, if we don't practice appropriate personal hygiene, we're going to see spread of disease,"" he said, according to CNN.

— There are now more than 2.5 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. and more than 125,800 deaths, according to The Johns Hopkins dashboard. There are more than 10.1 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide.

— Yesterday, due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, California ordered bars to close in Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, San Joaquin and Tulare counties, according to a tweet from California Governor Gavin Newsom. He also recommended that bars close in Contra Costa, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Stanislaus and Ventura counties.

Gilead Sciences puts price on remdesivir, coronavirus cases increas in much of the U.S., The pandemic 'is not even close to being over,' WHO director-general says

— Gilead Sciences will charge $390 per vial of remdesivir, which equates to be $2,340 per treatment for one person, according to an open letter from Daniel O'Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences. That's assuming that the majority of patients will use 6 vials of remdesivir across a span of 5 days. That pricing is for governments of developed countries including the U.S. government, and Medicaid, according to CNN. But for U.S. private insurance companies, the cost will be $520 per vial, or up to $3,120 per treatment, according to the statement. Uninsured patients would also be charged $520 per vial, according to The New York Times. In developing countries, the price will be lower, O'Day wrote in the statement.

Results from a study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on COVID-19 patients suggested that remdesivir shortened recovery time by four days, on average, O'Day wrote in the letter. So that would equate to hospital savings of about $12,000 per patient in the U.S., he wrote. ""Even just considering these immediate savings to the healthcare system alone, we can see the potential value that remdesivir provides. This is before we factor in the direct benefit to those patients who may have a shorter stay in the hospital,"" O'Day wrote.

Remdesivir, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola has been shown to improve recovery times for COVID-19 patients in clinical trials. It is currently the only drug that has emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus patients, according to CNN.

— Coronavirus cases are increasing in much of the U.S., and in many of those places, the number of people hospitalized and the percentage of people testing positive are also increasing which is telling that the spikes aren't the sole result of increased testing, according to The New York Times. New cases are decreasing in just seven places: Maryland, Rhode Island, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to a Times analysis. Case counts have mostly stayed the same in the last 14 days in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota, Maine and Guam. In the majority of states, case counts have increased in the last 14 days. Cases are increasing in California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Washington, South Carolina, Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Utah, Arkansas, Nevada, Kentucky, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Delaware, Oregon, Idaho, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alaska, Hawaii and Montana, according to The Times.

— The pandemic ""is not even close to being over,"" World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom said during a media briefing today. Tomorrow will be six months since the WHO first received reports of a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases in China, he said. ""Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world – and our lives – would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus.The pandemic has brought out the best and the worst of humanity,"" he said. Many countries have implemented measures to suppress transmission and save lives, he said. Those measures have slowed — but not stopped — the spread of the virus, he added. Now, as some countries reopen their economies and society, they are seeing a resurgence of cases, he said. ""Most people remain susceptible. The virus still has a lot of room to move. We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is: this is not even close to being over. Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,"" Adhanom said.

New Jersey won't resume indoor dining amid spikes in other states and Kansas will require people to wear masks in public places

— Indoor dining in New Jersey will no longer resume on Thursday, according to a tweet from the state's Gov. Phil Murphy. The plan was to loosen restrictions but after COVID-19 spiked in other states ""driven by, in part, the return of indoor dining, we have decided to postpone indoor dining indefinitely,"" he wrote. ""We’re also moved to pause indoor dining because of what we’ve seen in some establishments across the state. Overcrowding. A complete disregard for social distancing. Very few, IF ANY, face coverings.The scenes we see in our newspapers and on social media CANNOT CONTINUE,"" he wrote in the Twitter thread. Many establishments' owners, managers and customers have been responsible in following guidance and protecting people from the virus, he wrote. But ""The carelessness of one establishment can completely undo the good work of many others,"" he wrote.

New coronavirus cases in the U.S. could surpass 100,000 a day if the outbreak continues at this pace, Fauci says

— New coronavirus cases in the U.S. could surpass 100,000 a day if the outbreak continues at this pace, Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said today, according to CNBC. The U.S., which is currently tallying nearly 40,000 new cases a day, is ""not in total control"" of the pandemic, he said. About 50% of cases are coming from Florida, California, Texas and Arizona, he said. “I can’t make an accurate prediction but it’s going to be very disturbing,” Fauci said in a hearing held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to CNBC. “We are now having 40-plus-thousand new cases a day. I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around, and so I am very concerned.”

— There are now more than 2.6 million people who have been infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. and more than 127,400 people who have died, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. There are now 45 states that are reporting seven-day averages that are higher than a week ago, according to The Washington Post.

In other words, many Americans with COVID-19 don’t know how they were infected. The survey was conducted as a telephone interview with 350 adults in nine states who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 31 and May 10, according to the report. The findings suggest that many people may be getting infected through community transmission and not from a familiar person in their lives, the CDC said, according to the report. This ""underscores the need for isolation of infected persons, contact tracing and testing … and prevention measures, including social distancing and use of cloth face coverings,"" while community transmission is ongoing, the authors said.

In fact, the country’s coronavirus death rate has fallen for nine weeks in a row. However, 2,417 more people died at home in Scotland during the pandemic than expected based on the average from the past five years, the figures show. In total, Scotland has reported 4,155 deaths known or suspected to be tied to the coronavirus, according to the BBC.

— Scientists in China identified a new flu virus in pigs that they warned could possibly cause a future flu pandemic, according to a Live Science report. The virus, called G4 EA H1N1, is a genetic mix of the H1N1 ""swine flu,"" which caused a flu pandemic in 2009, and other flu viruses, the scientists reported in a new study published Monday (June 29) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists found evidence that G4 EA H1N1 has infected workers on pig farms in China. But there’s nothing to indicate that the virus spreads between people, according to the report. The authors caution that the virus is not an immediate health threat, but that controlling this virus in pig populations and monitoring for signs of it in humans ""should be urgently implemented,” according to the report.

There are several exceptions to his order, which include children younger than 10 years old, people with medical conditions that prevent them from wearing a mask, people who are eating, drinking or exercising outdoors, according to The Tribune. ""COVID-19 is not going away,"" Abbott said in a video message. ""In fact, it’s getting worse. Now, more than ever, action by everyone is needed until treatments are available for COVID-19."" On Wednesday, Texas had 8,076 new cases of COVID-19, hitting another record with over 1,000 cases more than the previous day, according to the Tribune.

— Starting tomorrow, Nashville in Tennessee will revert back to a ""modified version of Phase 2,"" Mayor John Cooper announced today. That means bars will close for at least 2 weeks; restaurants, gyms and high-touch businesses can open at 50% capacity, retail stores at 75% capacity and gatherings will be limited to 25 people, he wrote. Basketball courts, dog parks, splash pads, skate parks and recreational sports leagues can remain open. ""All residents must continue to wear masks when leaving home. Residents 65+ or with underlying health conditions should remain at home,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Our top priority is the health and safety of our community, and it will continue to drive the decisions regarding the reopening of Nashville."" There were more than 600 new cases reported in Nashville today, bringing the weekly total to over 2,000 in the city, according to News Channel 5 Nashville. Tennessee has now reported 46,890 cases of COVID-19, more than 1,500 more since yesterday, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.

— Nine more NBA players have tested positive for the coronavirus, the NBA and NBPA announced in a statement today, according to NPR. In tests conducted between June 24 to June 29, an additional nine players have tested positive for the coronavirus. That means that, in total, 25 out of 344 NBA players or 7% of the league have tested positive for COVID-19, according to NPR. The league is scheduled to start up again on July 30 in Orlando, Florida, according to NPR.

UK to open pubs, Texas health system bursting at seams with surge in COVID-19

—Britain's prime minister Boris Johnson announced that bars (i.e. pubs) will open beginning at 6 a.m. Saturday (July 4), though he urges people not to ""overdo it,"" The New York Times reported. Along with restaurants, hair salons and some other businesses that are also reopening, pubs will have to keep a 21-day record of all customers. In the instance of new cases, the government will be able to trace contacts and hopefully contain the outbreaks. About 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of London, Leicester will remain closed for business due to a regional outbreak of COVID-19, the Times said. The U.K. has the third highest death toll — 44,080 deaths — related to the coronavirus pandemic and the sixth highest case count in the world, with the country logging 285,268 COVID-19 cases to date, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.

—Nursing home residents will get COVID-19 tests every month in the U.K., the Times reported, while staff will be tested weekly. About 5,126 of the country's nursing homes (or 56%) have reported at least one case of the virus and 20% of residents — and 7% of staff — at those facilities have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a survey by the country's Office for National Statistics. At least 15,500 nursing home residents have died from COVID-19 to date, according to the survey.

—The state of Texas is dealing with a health care system now bursting at the seams, after cases have surged there. The number of new daily cases is three times higher in Texas than it was in April. Over the past week, the state has been averaging nearly 6,300 cases a day, The Washington Post reported. To date, 183,044 Texans have tested positive for COVID-19 and 2,585 have died as a result, according to Worldometer, which collects data on coronavirus cases. According to the Post, the surge in Texas has led to ""overwhelmed testing centers, lines at emergency rooms and crowded intensive care units, where it is difficult to maintain adequate numbers of specialized staff.""

Secret Service agents, NASCAR driver and 89 fraternity students test positive

—U.S. Vice President Mike Pence decided to forgo his travel on Tuesday (June 30) to Arizona due to factors related to the coronavirus, according to someone familiar with the situation, The New York Times reported. The decision came after Secret Service agents who were slated to accompany Pence tested positive for COVID-19 or were showing symptoms, according to the Times. Pence was expected to headline a ""Faith in America"" campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, followed by a tour of Yuma, the Times said. Instead, he made a shorter visit, participating in a public health briefing at an international airport in Phoenix. To date, the state has logged 91,858 cases and 1,788 related deaths, according to Worldometer. The state is one of the hot spots in the U.S. where cases have surged after early reopenings.

—NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 and will therefore miss Sunday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, The Washington Post reported. He is the first NASCAR racer to test positive. Though he wasn't showing any symptoms, he got a test after his wife showed allergy-like symptoms, according to the Post. The seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion won't be able to race again until he is symptom-free, has two negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart and he is cleared by a doctor, the Post said.

—At least 89 students at the University of Washington in Seattle have tested positive for COVID-19, NBC News reported. The students are part of the school's fraternities. That number could be higher, as at least 117 students living in 15 of the school's fraternity houses have reported that they have the virus. The school is trying to verify those cases. None of the students have been hospitalized, NBC News reported. ""While we were pleased to see most of the houses had previously taken measures to reduce resident capacity by up to 50 percent this summer in response to COVID-19, those measures are not sufficient without vigilant, daily preventive measures, such as wearing face coverings, physical distancing and hand hygiene,"" said Dr. Geoffrey Gottlieb, chair of the university's Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, NBC News reported.

Could smell tests help flag early COVID-19 infections?

From daycares to some workplaces to airports, many reopened establishments are using temperature checks to help identify those infected with COVID-19 before they spread it to others, However, as reported by Stat News, these checks are like ""trying to catch tennis balls in a soccer net: way too many can get through."" That's because a good chunk of those with the disease show no symptoms at all. In addition, those with fevers might not have the disease at all. Some scientists are suggesting that adding a smell test to these routine screenings could help to identify ""My impression is that anosmia is an earlier symptom of Covid-19 relative to fever, and some infected people can have anosmia and nothing else,"" said Dr. Andrew Badley, head of a virus lab at the Mayo Clinic. ""So it's potentially a more sensitive screen for asymptomatic patients.""

In a study published to the preprint server medrXiv, Badley and colleagues found that people infected with COVID-19 were 27 times more likely than non-infected individuals to have lost their sense of smell, Stat News reported. Even so, these individuals were just 2.6 times more likely than the non-infected to have a fever or chills.

Here's why loss of smell may be an early sign of infection: Cells in the tissue that lines the nasal passages are covered with the receptors that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) grabs onto in order to enter those cells. In that way, these nasal cells would be some of the first to be exposed to the virus and become infected before the virus enters the body and triggers an immune response that would cause a fever, Stat News reported.

""These support cells either secrete molecules that shut down the olfactory receptor neurons, or stop working and starve the neurons, or somehow fail to support the neurons,"" said Danielle Reed, associate director of Monell Chemical Senses Center, Stat News reported. Then, these olfactory neurons ""either stop working or die.""

Study: Even without antibodies, you may be immune to coronavirus

Even if you tested negative for antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, there's a chance you are still immune to the virus called SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), according to a study out of Sweden. In the study, the researchers at the Karolinska Institute tested 200 people for both coronavirus antibodies and T-cells — a type of white blood cell produced by the body's immune system to fight off intruders (like SARS-CoV-2). The researchers found that for every person who tested positive for antibodies, two people tested positive for the T-cells that identify and destroy SARS-CoV-2, BBC News reported. These T-cells were found in individuals who had mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.

Like antibodies, T-cells identify certain pathogens and then hold onto that memory so that when those intruders pop up again the specific T-cells can target the virus and kill it, BBC News reported. The researchers aren't sure why individuals with negative antibody tests were showing such T-cells, but they speculated that perhaps the patients had mounted an antibody response that had since faded to at least the point where the antibodies weren't detectable.

The researchers also aren't sure what kind of immunity these T-cells might provide to individuals who are not also carrying SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. It's likely that the individuals are protected from reinfection. However, the researchers noted that further studies are needed to figure out whether the T-cells provide what is called sterilizing immunity — meaning they block the virus completely so that not only is the person protected from getting sick but they also can't transmit the virus.

So what does this all mean? ""Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in,"" study researcher Marcus Buggert, assistant professor at the Center for Infectious Medicine at the Karolinska Institute, said in a statement from the institute. The study was published to the preprint server bioRxiv, meaning it has yet to be peer-reviewed by others in the field.

Black and Latino people face brunt of coronavirus, new data reveals

The racial disparities in who is taking the brunt of the novel coronavirus has become even more clear after The New York Times sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain federal data on the matter. In the most comprehensive look at nearly 1.5 million Americans infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) through the end of May, the Times found that ""Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups,"" the Times reported. Black and Latino people in the U.S. have been three times more likely to contract the virus and nearly twice as likely to die from it compared with white people, the Times said. Those numbers came from data on 640,000 infections in nearly 1,000 U.S. counties. However, race and ethnicity information was missing from more than half of the cases; in addition, another important piece of information — how the individual contracted the virus — was also missing.

Experts contacted by the Times revealed reasons why Black and Latino individuals would be more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. According to the Times, many of these individuals have frontline jobs that don't allow for work-from-home conveniences; they rely on public transportation; and they often live in tight quarters or in multigenerational homes (meaning a lot of people in a small area where social-distancing would be impossible and where one individual could spread the virus to several others).

""You literally can't isolate with one bathroom,"" said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, head of Michigan's task force on coronavirus racial disparities, the Times reported.

For instance, a 26-year-old Latino woman spoke to the Times about her experience with the coronavirus. She gave only her first name, Diana, for fear her husband might lose his job, but said that in April her husband contracted the virus at a construction site where they live in Fairfax, Virginia. Diana and her brother, also a construction worker, soon caught the virus as well. The couple and brother have three children between them, meaning six family members lived in a two-bedroom apartment.

""We have to go out to work,"" Diana told the Times. ""We have to pay our rent. We have to pay our utilities. We just have to keep working.""

Scientists urge WHO to acknowledge role of airborne transmission in COVID-19

— More than 200 scientists are calling on the World Health Organization to better address the role of airborne transmission in the spread of the new coronavirus. In an upcoming paper in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, the scientists say there is growing evidence that the virus can spread through tiny aerosols that hang in the air, so-called ""airborne transmission, according to The Washington Post. Currently, WHO maintains that the virus spreads primarily through droplet transmission, when droplets from coughs and sneezes are expelled from people's mouths and fall quickly to the floor, and airborne transmission is only a possibility only during certain hospital procedures, according to The New York Times. The paper asks the agency to revise its recommendations in light of the evidence for airborne transmission, which would allow the virus to spread easily in crowded, poorly ventilated areas. ""We are hoping that WHO will come around and be more willing to acknowledge the important roles of aerosols,"" Donald Milton, one of the authors and a professor at the University of Maryland, told CNN.

— Broadway actor Nick Cordero died on Sunday (July 5) at age 41 after being hospitalized for three months with COVID-19, according to The New York Times. Cordero reportedly had no underlying health conditions, but had experienced a number of complications from the infection, including the need for a ventilator and a medically-induced coma, and the amputation of his right leg, the Times reported. Cordero received a Tony nomination for his role in ""Bullets Over Broadway.""

""Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician,"" Cordero's wife, Amanda Kloots, wrote on Instagram. ""Elvis [Cordero and Kloots' son] and I will miss him in everything we do, everyday,"" she said.

Miami rolls back openings as COVID-19 cases rise

— As Florida continues to see an increase in COVID-19 cases, Miami-Dade County is rolling back some business openings. In a statement on Monday, the County's Mayor, Carlos Gimenez said that restaurants will be closed for in-person dining; and gyms and fitness centers, and short-term rentals would also need to close again. The emergency order takes effect Wednesday, July 8. ""We can tamp down the spread if everyone follows the rules, wears masks and stays at least six feet apart from others,"" Gimenez said. On the July 4 holiday, Florida set a new record for daily cases in the state when it reported more than 11,400 cases, according to The New York Times.

But in the spring, first-years would return home and seniors would be invited back to campus to complete their final semester, according to a statement from the university. All classes will be conducted online, even for students living on campus. Students will live in single bedrooms and use a shared bathroom. Students including sophomores and juniors who are not invited back to campus for the academic year will be given the opportunity to attend summer courses without tuition in 2021.

Atlanta Mayor tests positive for COVID-19

— Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has tested positive for COVID-19, according to CNN. She broke the news in a post on Twitter, and said she has had no symptoms. Both Bottoms and her husband tested positive, but the pair has no idea how they were exposed, she said in an interview with MSNBC, according to CNN. ""It's a shock … it leaves me at a loss for words,"" she said.

— The National Hockey League (NHL) announced that 35 of its players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8, according to The Hill. In a statement, the league said that 396 players had participated in voluntary, small-group workouts, known as Phase 2 activities, and of these, 23 had tested positive. In total, there have been more than 2,900 tests administered to the players participating in Phase 2 activities. The NHL said it is also aware of 12 additional players who have tested positive but were not involved with these practice activities. The news comes as the league announced that it will resume its season on Aug. 1 and will begin formal training camps on July 13, according to CNN.

Brazilian President tests positive for COVID-19

— The President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for COVID-19, according to The New York Times. Bolsonaro took a coronavirus test on Monday evening after reportedly experiencing symptoms such as a fever, the Times reported. ""Everyone knew that it would reach a considerable part of the population sooner or later. It was positive for me,"" Bolsonaro said on Brazilian TV channels on Tuesday (July 7), according to CNN. Bolsonaro has previously dismissed the threat of the new coronavirus, referring to the virus as a ""little flu,"" appearing in public without a mask and encouraging the country to reopen, according to CNN. But after his positive test, Bolsonaro appeared on TV wearing a mask and urged people not to get close to him. Bolsonaro also said that a lung screening showed his lungs are ""clean"" so far, CNN reported. Brazil has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world (with 1.6 million cases), behind only the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.

— After experiencing relatively few COVID-19 cases early on, the city of Melbourne, Australia has gone under lockdown again amid a spike in cases, according to The Washington Post. Residents of the city, which has a population of around 5 million people, will need to stay at home except for essential activities such as grocery shopping, exercise, medical care or work at certain businesses, and they won't be allowed to leave the city. The Australian state of Victoria, which includes Melbourne, was recently reporting just a handful of coronavirus cases each day, but over the last month cases have increased, and on Tuesday (July 7) it reported a record 191 cases, the Post reported.

Trump administration announces formal withdrawal from WHO

— The Trump administration has given formal notice that it will withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization, which is part of the United Nations, according to The New York Times. By law, the U.S. must give WHO a year's notice before withdrawing, and officials said the notice would take effect July 6, 2021. The U.S. is the largest funder of WHO, responsible for $426 million a year in the 2018-2019 budget period, Live Science reported. Many public health experts, as well as politicians, denounced the move. In a statement, Elizabeth Cousens, president of the United Nations Foundation (a private organization that promotes UN interests), called the move ""short-sighted, unnecessary, and unequivocally dangerous.""

— Vice President Pence said in a news briefing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will issue new guidance for school openings next week, according to The Washington Post. The announcement came shortly after the CDC's original recommendations were criticized by President Trump. The new guidance will involve five documents that will provide ""even more clarity"" on the topic of school reopenings, Pence said. Also at the briefing, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said that ""there is a variety of unique circumstances for different schools,"" and that he and the CDC would be disappointed ""if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools.""

NJ now requires face masks outside, President Trump's rally likely led to a spike in new coronavirus cases

— New Jersey is now requiring people to wear face masks outdoors when social distancing isn’t possible, according to NJ.com. Face coverings have been required indoors in New Jersey since early April but were only strongly encouraged outside, according to NJ.com. The new order requires face masks outside when social distancing isn’t possible. “This is absolutely vital when individuals find themselves in a crowded situation — such as when walking down a packed boardwalk or in a line that is not properly spaced apart,” Gov. Phil Murphy said yesterday at a news briefing, according to NJ.com. But there are exceptions. For example, masks aren’t required if you’re walking alone or with family in the neighborhood, beach or park and can stand at least 6 feet from others, he said.

— President Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa in late June likely led to a spike in new coronavirus cases, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said on Wednesday, according to AP News. Tulsa County confirmed 261 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, a record-high and 206 cases on Tuesday, according to AP News. The week before the rally, Tulsa County reported 76 cases on Monday and 96 cases on Tuesday, according to AP News. “In the past few days, we’ve seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, so I guess we just connect the dots,” Dart said, according to AP News.

— The U.S. reported 62,751 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, another record, according to The Washington Post. More than 3 million people have now been infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. and more than 132,300 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard.

States that are facing surges in coronavirus cases should consider shutting down again, Fauci says

— States that are facing really high numbers of coronavirus cases should consider shutting down again, Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said on Wednesday, according to The Washington Post. “I think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down,” he said in a Wall Street Journal podcast, according to the Post. “It’s not for me to say, because each state is different.”

— The pandemic is still accelerating, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization Director-General, said today, according to CNBC. “The virus can be brought under control,” he said in a member states mission briefing in Geneva, according to CNBC. “But in most of the world, the virus is not under control; it’s getting worse.” In the last six weeks, the total number of cases across the globe has doubled, he said, according to CNBC. “The virus has upended health systems in some of the world’s wealthiest nations, while some countries that have mounted a successful response have been of modest means,” Ghebreyesus said.

WHO releases new guidance on airborne transmission, but it doesn't change much

— There are now more than 12.2 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 555,500 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In the U.S., there are more than 3.1million cases and more than 133,200 deaths tied to the virus.

— The World Health Organization (WHO) released updated coronavirus guidance on airborne transmission, but the institution's stance on the topic remains largely unchanged, according to a new Live Science report. In the new guidance, released Thursday (July 9), WHO said that airborne transmission — or spread through particles known as aerosols which hover in the air after a person has left the area — of COVID-19 in crowded, indoor locations with poor ventilation ""cannot be ruled out."" The new guidance comes after more than 200 scientists signed a letter urging WHO to acknowledge the role of airborne transmission with COVID-19. But it's not clear that airborne transmission is playing a big role in the spread of COVID-19, according to experts contacted by Live Science.

WHO says that COVID-19 is largely spread through droplet transmission, when droplets from coughs and sneezes are expelled from people's mouths and fall quickly to the floor or onto another person, according to the report. Still, WHO recommends people to ""avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation,"" and to wear fabric masks or face coverings in public places.

Gilead Sciences say Remdesivir reduces risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 62%. But their results aren't from a randomized controlled clinical trial.

— The antiviral drug remdesivir might reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 62% compared to standard care, Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, said today, according to CNBC. The analysis isn't yet published in a study and wasn't part of a randomized controlled clinical trial, but is being presented in the 23rd International AIDS (virtual) conference, according to the company. “While not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial, this analysis importantly draws from a realworld setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data, adding to our collective understanding of this virus and reflecting the extraordinary pace of the ongoing pandemic,” Dr. Susan Olender at Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in a statement, according to CNBC. The company analyzed data from 312 patients enrolled in its phase 3 clinical trial and compared the data with 818 patients in real-world settings who received standard care, according to CNBC. However, different conditions between the clinical trial group and the real world group could have altered the results, according to CNBC.

— The U.S. reported more than 59,880 coronavirus cases yesterday, another daily record for the sixth time in 10 days, according to The New York Times. Alabama, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oregon and Texas all set daily records yesterday, according to the Times. Florida with 120 new deaths and Tennessee with 22 new deaths both recorded their highest daily death toll yesterday, according to the Times.

Small study finds the cases of broken heart syndrome increased amid pandemic and an ""unknown pneumonia"" in Kazakhstan is likely undiagnosed cases of COVID-19

— A Chinese embassy issued a warning about a deadly ""unknown pneumonia"" circulating in Kazakhstan, but authorities outside of China say these cases are likely undiagnosed cases of COVID-19, according to a Live Science report. The warning said that the unidentified pneumonia had killed more than 1,700 people in Kazakhstan, but authorities denied such an outbreak, according to the report. A statement from Kazakhstan's health ministry said that there were ""viral pneumonias of unspecified etiology"" in the country. However, the statement said that the classification of ""unspecified"" was used for cases of COVID-19 that had been diagnosed based on symptoms but not confirmed with lab testing, according to the report. Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that the news of this outbreak ""is certainly on our radar,"" and that the organization is working with authorities in Kazakhstan to investigate it but that the cases are likely undiagnosed COVID-19, according to the report.

— Cardiologists in Ohio have found that the number of patients experiencing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome, increased four-to-five fold during the coronavirus pandemic compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to a small new study, Live Science reported. In the new study, researchers analyzed data from 258 patients who came to the Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Akron General with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) between March 1 and April 30, corresponding to the time period when the pandemic was first taking off in the U.S. They then compared these patients with four control groups of ACS patients who came to the clinics before the pandemic. The researchers found that 7.8% of ACS patients were diagnosed with broken heart syndrome during the pandemic, compared with 1.5% to 1.8% before the pandemic. What's more, they found that patients who had broken heart syndrome during the pandemic stayed at the hospital for longer than those in the pre-pandemic groups, according to the report. The researchers didn't find any differences in mortality rates, however. ""While the pandemic continues to evolve, self-care during this difficult time is critical to our heart health, and our overall health,"" senior author Dr. Grant Reed, director of Cleveland Clinic's ST-elevation myocardial infarction program, said in a statement. ""For those who feel overwhelmed by stress, it's important to reach out to your health care provider.""

Scottish pilot leaves Vietnam hospital after given 10% odds of survival

Stephen Cameron, who spent more than 2 months on life support after being infected with COVID-19, has been released from Cho Ray Hospital in Vietnam, The New York Times reported. Known as Patient 91, the 43-year-old Scottish pilot traveled to Ho Chi Minh City in February to start a job at Vietnam Airlines. Then, in March he contracted the novel coronavirus after hanging out at a bar that became Vietnam's largest outbreak.

For much of his 2-plus months in a medically induced coma, Cameron's body depended on an Ecmo machine, which extracts a patient's blood, infuses it with oxygen and then pumps it back into their body, BBC News reported. Meanwhile, multiple complications from the coronavirus ensued: His blood became sticky, causing blood clots; his kidneys failed, requiring him to go on dialysis; and his lung capacity dropped to just 10%, BBC News reported.

Many of his friends back home in the U.K. didn't think he would make it, and one — who was told Cameron had a 10% chance of survival — ""gave up my apartment and started doing things somebody would do if I was coming home in a box,"" Cameron said, as reported by BBC News.

After spending 2 months in a medically induced coma, Cameron faces a long road to recovery, his doctors said.

""I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors,"" Cameron said in a video before departing on his flight home, the Times reported. ""The odds say that I shouldn't be here, and so I can only thank everybody here for doing what they have done.""

The country itself is considered a COVID-19 success story; it's the largest country to report zero deaths from the virus and no cases of local person-to-person transmission of the virus have been reported since the middle of April, according to the Times. To date, the country of 95.5 million has reported a total of 370 COVID-19 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.

COVID-19 deaths now increasing in the US

Even as COVID-19 cases began to surge in the U.S., driven by a handful of states that had reopened early, the daily deaths were flat or even decreasing. An upturn was expected, as deaths do lag behind case numbers, and it's here, according to a report by The Associated Press.

An analysis by the AP with data from the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard found that the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths reported from COVID-19 has increased from about 578 two weeks ago to 664 on July 10. While that number is still below the daily deaths being reported in the U.S. during the pandemic peak in April, the numbers look worse when state numbers are analyzed. The majority of the states where deaths have increased are averaging about 15 new deaths per day, with a small subset of states driving the death surge in the U.S.

For instance, California has averaged about 91 deaths per day and Texas with 66, the AP reported. On July 10, Florida logged 92 deaths related to COVID-19, with 120 the day before, The Washington Post reported. Arizona, another state where cases have skyrocketed, reported 75 and 44 deaths on Thursday and Friday (July 9-10), respectively, according to the Post.

Experts contacted by the AP say that while they expect these deaths to continue to rise for the next few weeks, those deaths will likely not reach those seen in the spring. The AP noted several reasons for that hope: Testing is more widespread and outbreaks are better understood; lifestyles have changed, with many people wearing masks and social distancing, while doctors have a better handle on how to treat COVID-19 patients; and deadly viruses tend to wreak havoc right away on the most vulnerable populations, which have now already been hit by the virus.

Sunday, July 12, 9am 61 US marines in Japan test positive, causing concern on Okinawa

More than 60 U.S. marines at two bases on Okinawa Island in Japan have tested positive for COVID-19 since July 7, The Guardian reported. Thirty-eight of the cases were reported at at marine corps air station Futenma, and another 23 at Camp Hansen. Now, the governor of the island is telling the U.S. it needs to step up its disease-prevention measures.

""It is extremely regrettable that the infections are rapidly spreading among US personnel when we Okinawans are doing our utmost to contain the infections,"" Gov. Denny Tamaki said on the phone to Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, according to The Guardian. ""We now have strong doubts that the US military has taken adequate disease-prevention measures.""

About half of about 50,000 American troops in Japan live on Okinawa. Quarantining U.S. military members who arrive from the U.S. for staff rotations is another concern, as shortage of space on base has led to off-base hotel quarantines, The Guardian reported.

The U.S. Marines said it will now restrict off-base activities. Those who tested positive are now in isolation. To date, Okinawa has logged 152 COVID-19 cases and seven related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.

Record 15,300 new cases in Florida, Globe sees record cases, and COVID-19 cluster in Sydney

—Florida recorded the highest single-day tally of new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, logging 15,300 new cases, according to Worldometer, which is tracking COVID-19 stats. The state also logged 45 new deaths related to the disease. In total, Florida has confirmed 269,811 COVID-19 cases and 4,242 related deaths. This past week, the Sunshine State reported an average of 73 coronavirus fatalities a day, The Associated Press reported. That number was at 30 just three weeks ago, the AP said.

—The world also had a record day for new cases. Over just 24 hours, the globe reported a total of 230,370 new cases of COVID-19, a record number, according to the World Health Organization, The Guardian reported. The countries contributing the most to that number were: the U.S., Brazil, India and South Africa. On July 10, the globe reported the previous record of 228,102 new cases, according to The Guardian. Global deaths from the disease have remained relatively steady with an average of 5,000 per day. To date, the world has seen nearly 12.86 million cases and 567,957 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.

—A cluster of nine COVID-19 cases have been linked to a hotel in Sydney, Australia. The hotel, called Crossroads Hotel, said that anyone who had visited its pub, called Casula, between July 3 and July 10 should self-isolate, The Guardian reported. ""Part of the concern is that this hotel is used by freight drivers who are transporting essential supplies across the country. So this is a really important issue for everyone across the country,"" said Michael Kidd, the deputy chief medical officer, as reported by The Guardian. ""It is very important that anyone who was connected with that hotel does lock down."" As of this evening, the original case of the cluster is not known, said Dr. Kerry Chant, New South Wales chief health officer, The Guardian reported.

NYC reports zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic

— There are now 12.9 million people who have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide and 569,697 who have died, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In the U.S., 3.3 million people have been infected and more than 135,200 have died; in Brazil, 1.8 million people have been infected and 72,100 have died; In India, 878,200 have been infected and more than 23,100 have died; in Russia, 732,547 have been infected and more than 11,400 have died; in Peru more than 326,300 have been infected and more than 11,800 have died.

— On July 11, New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, according to NBC News. New York City hasn't had a single day without a death related to the virus since March 13, according to NBC News.

— The right kind of UV light, at the right kind of dosage, can kill SARS-COV-2, according to a Live Science report. But many at-home UV lights claiming to kill the new coronavirus likely won't work, according to the report. UV radiation can be classified into three types based on wavelength: UVA, UVB and UVC. The latter, with the shortest wavelength and highest energy, can act as a disinfectant, according to the report. UVC has been used for years and has proven effective in inactivating H1N1 influenza and other coronaviruses, according to the report. That being said, UVC can damage DNA which makes it very dangerous to human skin and eyes, Indermeet Kohli, a physicist who studies photomedicine in dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, told Live Science, according to the report. So UVC technology should primarily be operated by medical facilities and should be evaluated for safety and efficacy, she said.

Amid a continuing rise in coronavirus cases, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered many indoor operations to close

— Amid a continuing rise in coronavirus cases, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered indoor operations to close in restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, family entertainment, zoos, museums, and cardrooms, according to a tweet from Newsom. He ordered bars to close all operations. “The data suggests not everyone is acting with common sense,” Newsom said at a press conference Monday, according to CNBC. The state reported more than 8,300 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, according to CNBC. This order is one of the largest rollbacks since states began to reopen, according to CNBC. San Diego Unified and Los Angeles Unified School Districts — California's two largest school districts — announced today that the new school year will start online, according to a statement.

— An estimated 5.4 million people in the U.S. lost their health insurance between February and May during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The New York Times. A new study by the advocacy group Families U.S.A found that increase in uninsured laid-off workers over this period was almost 40 percent higher than the increase during the 2008-2009 recession, the Times reported. In Texas alone, the number of people uninsured leaped from 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, according to the Times. In the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (37 states), 23% of laid off workers became uninsured; in the states that didn't (13 states), 43% of laid-off workers became uninsured, the Times reported.

43 new coronavirus cases linked to single house party in Michigan; cases across the country continue to surge

— In Michigan, 43 new coronavirus cases have been linked to a single house party, according to CNN. Health officials are asking anyone who attended the party, which took place between July 2 and July 3 to self-quarantine and monitor symptoms for 14 days, according to CNN. Most of the new cases were among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, according to a statement from Washtenaw County in Michigan. The health department also identified 66 exposed close contacts — or anyone who had face-to-face contact with a positive case for 15 minutes or more, not including family members in the same household, according to the statement. ""This is a very clear example of how quickly this virus spreads and how many people can be impacted in a very short amount of time,"" Jimena Loveluck, a Health Officer at the Washtenaw County Health Department said in the statement. ""We cannot hope to accomplish our goal of containing COVID-19 and preventing additional cases, hospitalizations and deaths without full community support and cooperation.""

""We need people of all ages, including young people, to take COVID-19 seriously and follow public health guidelines and instructions. That means avoiding large gatherings without physical distancing or face coverings. It also means cooperating with the Health Department to complete case investigation and contact tracing,"" Loveluck said.

— There are now more than 3.3 million people who have been infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. and more than 135,600 who have died from the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. Cases continue to increase across the U.S. ""Miami is now the epicenter of the pandemic,"" Lilian Abbo with the Jackson Health System said during a press conference, CNN reported. There are more than 2,000 patients hospitalized and hundreds in the intensive care units in Miami, according to CNN. “What we were seeing in Wuhan — six months ago, five months ago — now we are there,"" Abbo said. Meanwhile, Texas hospitals are running out of beds, ventilators, drugs and staff, according to The Texas Tribune. ""It’s going to be a rough few weeks,"" John Henderson, president of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals told the Tribune. ""Most everything we’re seeing is worrisome or scary."" Texas has now reported more than 264,300 cases of COVID-19 and more than 3,200 deaths, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services dashboard. Arizona ICU’s are nearly fully and the state has reported more than 2,500 new coronavirus cases on Sunday and over the past week, nearly 27% of tests in the state came back positive — the highest rate in the country, according to CBS News. ""We have for the last three weeks been the worst in the entire country,"" Will Humble, the executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association and former director of the Arizona Department of Health Services told CBS News. ""People sacrificed so much during the stay-at-home order with their jobs, and then when it wasn't phased, as we transitioned into a post-stay-at-home, we'd lost that progress.""

Florida and Alabama see record number of coronavirus-related deaths, the Tri-state area adds four states to its quarantine list

— Florida reported 132 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday, a record-number for the state, according to The New York Times. Alabama also set a record on Tuesday with 40 deaths, according to the Times. As of Monday, the U.S. is recording, on average, 724 deaths a day, whereas as the month began, the U.S. was averaging below 500, according to the Times.

— New Jersey, Connecticut and New York added four new states to its coronavirus quarantine travel advisory and removed Delaware from its advisory, according to NJ.com. People coming from the now 22 hotspot states that make up this list, are being asked to quarantine upon arrival to the Tri-state, according to NBC New York. States on the quarantine list are now: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio.

— Philadelphia is now prohibiting any large public event on public property, through February 28 of 2021, according to 6ABC. Mayor Jim Kenney's new order applies to special events and gatherings of 50 people or more on public property, according to 6ABC. Under this order, festivals, parades, concerts, carnivals, fairs and flea markets are prohibited as are residential block parties until further notice, Kenney announced today. This order, however, doesn't apply to demonstrations and first amendment-related activities, private events that are not advertised like family gatherings or weddings, recreational activities with fewer than 25 people and events taking place on private property such as performance venues, according to 6ABC.

CDC says wearing face masks is a 'civic duty'

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is calling on all Americans to wear face masks in public settings. The agency has recommended masks for months, but in an editorial published Tuesday (July 14) in the journal JAMA, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and colleagues cited new evidence that face coverings help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The authors pointed to a new report on cases of COVID-19 at a hair salon in Missouri, which showed that two infected hair stylists did not spread the disease to any of their 139 clients when the stylists and customers wore masks. The editorial also cited the case of a hospital system in Boston, which reduced COVID-19 transmission after a universal mask policy. ""At this critical juncture when COVID-19 is resurging, broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty, a small sacrifice reliant on a highly effective low-tech solution that can help turn the tide favorably in national and global efforts against COVID-19,"" the authors wrote.

The United States reported a record 67,417 new coronavirus cases yesterday

— The United States reported 67,417 new coronavirus cases yesterday, a new daily record for the country, according to CNBC. Daily cases in the U.S. have been averaging about 62,210 over the past week, which is up more than 21% from last week's average and more than three times the average from a month ago, according to CNBC. Texas, California and Florida made up nearly half of those new cases reported yesterday.

— More than 30 COVID-19 candidate vaccines are being tested in clinical trials, according to a Live Science report. But given that most vaccines take years to develop, how will we know when the first coronavirus vaccine that's approved will be safe and effective? Experts told Live Science that all candidate COVID-19 vaccines must pass through the same clinical trial phases as any other vaccine, before earning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Provided that the trials include thousands of participants and thorough protocols to track side effects, the public can be confident that the approved vaccines are safe, they said, according to Live Science.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is now telling hospitals to send COVID-19 data to the agency, rather than to the CDC

— There have now been more than 13.4 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide and more than 580,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In Brazil there have been more than 1.9 million cases and more than 74,100 deaths; In India there have been more than 936,100 cases and more than 24,300 deaths; in Russia there have been more than 745,100 cases and more than 11,700 deaths; in Peru there have been more than 333,800 cases and more than 12,200 deaths, according to the dashboard.

— The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is no longer in charge of compiling COVID-19 data, according to a new Live Science report. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is now telling hospitals to send COVID-19 data to the agency, rather than to the CDC, which used to compile and share the data on publicly accessible databases, according to the report. The orders, posted to the HHS website, direct hospitals to send daily reports to the HHS about their total number of COVID-19 patients, admissions and related deaths from the previous day, their ICU bed occupancy, ventilators in use, staffing shortages and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), among other information, according to the report. But some health experts are voicing concerns about how this decision may limit the amount of data available to the public, scientists and health officials as the pandemic continues to rage across the country, according to the report.

— Moderna's experimental COVID-19 vaccine, called mRNA-1273, showed promising early results in 45 participants, according to data published in The New England Journal of Medicine. All of the participants in the trial, after receiving two doses of the vaccine, developed neutralizing antibodies — proteins that can block the new coronavirus from infecting cells, according to a Live Science report. These findings back up the results that Moderna released in May that hadn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, according to the report. The vaccine appeared safe and generally well-tolerated by participants, although more than half of participants experienced some side effects which can also occur with the annual flu shot, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle aches and pain at the injection site, according to the report. Some participants in the middle and high dose groups experienced a fever after the second injection, according to the report. The company has already started a Phase 2 trial and plans to start a larger Phase 3 trial in late July, according to the report.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order that bans cities from requiring masks, as the state records its second-highest number of daily coronavirus cases

— Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order that bans cities from requiring masks, according to The Washington Post. Kemp’s order, which nullifies already existing mask mandates in more than a dozen cities or counties, came as Georgia recorded 3,871 new coronavirus cases yesterday, the second-highest the state has seen since the start of the pandemic, the Post reported. “It is officially official. Governor Kemp does not give a damn about us,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson wrote on Twitter, the Post reported. “Every man and woman for himself/herself. Ignore the science and survive the best you can. In #Savannah, we will continue to keep the faith and follow the science. Masks will continue to be available!”

— Amid an uptick in cases , France will start requiring masks in all public indoor spaces starting next week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said today, according to The New York Times. Masks were already required on public transport in the country. Britain also announced this week that face coverings will be required in shops and supermarkets beginning at the end of next week, according to the Times.

— India recorded 32,695 new cases of the coronaviru on Thursday, the highest number of daily cases the country has seen since the start of the pandemic, according to NPR. The country now has more than 968,800 cases of COVID-19 (third most number of cases around the world, after Brazil and the U.S.) and more than 24,900 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In late March, India had put in place one of the first lockdowns in the world (and one of the strictest), but eased those restrictions in early June because of the damage it caused to the economy, according to NPR.

Researchers plan to recruit healthy volunteers for a challenge study to test experimental Oxford vaccine

— Researchers at Oxford University's Jenner Institute who are developing a candidate COVID-19 vaccine are hoping to start challenge studies on volunteers within months, according to The Guardian. These controversial challenge studies would deliberately expose healthy volunteers to the coronavirus after they have been given the experimental vaccine, according to a previous Live Science report. This would allow the trial to be completed within a couple of weeks with far fewer people than required in clinical trials in which people are given the vaccine and then monitored to see if it works in protecting people who naturally become exposed to the coronavirus, according to The Guardian. The Oxford vaccine has completed a phase 1 clinical trial with 1,000 British volunteers and tens of thousands of people globally are also being recruited for a phase 3 trial, according to The Guardian.

But the researchers are hoping to also complete the challenge study in parallel with the phase 3 trial or after the phase 3 trial is completed, accord",https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/coronavirus-outbreak-live-updates/ar-BB179PIG,28,Idaho,USA,"""Idaho"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
"COVID Is Spreading Much Faster Now Than It Was in the Spring, Study Finds",,"© Provided by Best Life

By now, the daily COVID-19 figures coming out of states like Arizona, Florida, Texas, and California are a grim reminder of just how quickly the virus has spread across the U.S. And while these hotspots have seen the most startling numbers, they are far from alone in watching the virus's pace quicken. Recent data shows that COVID-19 is spreading faster than it was in the spring in almost half of all U.S. states, according to a USA Today study.

Idaho, for example, originally saw low to stable increases in cases just months ago. In early April, the Gem State was reporting roughly five new cases per hour, before dropping to less than one per hour by mid-May, USA Today reports. But recent figures have shown that cases are now four-fold what they were before reopening in May, with about 20 new coronavirus cases cropping up per hour.

In addition to Idaho, other states and territories where cases are increasing faster than they were in the spring include Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

The doubling of case rates in a short period of time is becoming more troublingly common for many states in the Sun Belt region of the U.S.

But recent figures also show that COVID-19 is even spreading faster in states that were believed to have successfully beat the virus. Rhode Island, for example, had earned praise for its seemingly effective handling of the pandemic, but the state saw a 109 percent increase in new cases last week.

Fortunately, it's not all bad news. Outside of Rhode Island, the rest of the Northeast is one region of the U.S. which is showing signs of improvement, with case levels in states such as New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey far below what they saw in the spring, USA Today reports.

AP FACT CHECK: Trump's alternate reality on COVID-19 threat,07-20-2020 00:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump appears to be living in an alternate reality when it comes to the COVID-19 threat.

Over the weekend, he clung to the misguided notion that the virus will just “disappear” even as his top science experts and GOP allies bluntly say otherwise.

Trump also continued to wrongly insist that anyone who wants a coronavirus test is getting one, made the head-scratching suggestion that the virus is under control when infections are surging to fresh daily highs and lodged false accusations against the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci.

The statements came in a week of distorted truth. Trump referred repeatedly to his “ban” on travel from China that wasn’t so and issued a scattered indictment of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.

A look at his rhetoric and how they compare with the facts:

TRUMP vs. FAUCI

TRUMP: “Dr. Fauci at the beginning said, ‘This will pass. Don’t worry about it. This will pass.’ He was wrong.” - interview aired on “Fox News Sunday.”

THE FACTS: Trump is overstating it. While Fauci said in January and February that Americans need not panic about a virus threat at the time, he also said the situation was “evolving” and that public health officials were taking the threat seriously.

“Right now the risk is still low, but this could change, I’ve said that many times,” Fauci told NBC on Feb. 29. He allowed that if there are growing cases of community spread, it could become a “major outbreak.”

“When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread,” Fauci said.

Fauci never claimed the virus would just “pass” or disappear.

___

TRUMP: “Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: That’s incorrect. While Fauci expressed some initial reservations about travel restrictions on China, he supported the decision by the time it was made.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who was coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force at the time and announced the travel restrictions, said Trump made the decision in late January after accepting the “uniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS.”

While the World Health Organization did advise against the overuse of travel restrictions, Azar told reporters in February that his department’s career health officials had made a “considered recommendation, which I and the president adopted” in a bid to slow spread of the virus.

___

TRUMP: “I will be right eventually. You know I said, ‘It’s going to disappear.’ I’ll say it again. It’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right.” - Fox interview.

TRUMP: “We’ll put out the flames. … It’s going to be under control.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: “The virus is not going to disappear,” according to Fauci.

The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. per day has risen over the past month, hitting over 70,000 this past week, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. That is higher even than what the country experienced from mid-April through early May, when deaths sharply rose.

Fauci has warned that the increase across the South and West “puts the entire country at risk” and that new infections could reach 100,000 a day if people don’t start listening to guidance from public health authorities to wear a mask and practice social distancing.

Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have recently been forced to shut down bars and businesses as virus cases surge. The U.S. currently has more than 3.7 million known cases and many more undetected.

In February, Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going “very substantially down, not up,” and told Fox Business it will be fine because “in April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, visiting a hospital Wednesday in Kentucky, acknowledged that some of those early predictions were too rosy. “The straight talk here that everyone needs to understand: This is not going away,” he said.

Fauci says there “certainly” will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.

___

PETER NAVARRO, White House trade adviser: “When Fauci was telling the White House Coronavirus Task Force that there was only anecdotal evidence in support of hydroxychloroquine to fight the virus, I confronted him with scientific studies providing evidence of safety and efficacy. A recent Detroit hospital study showed a 50% reduction in the mortality rate when the medicine is used in early treatment.” - op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today.

THE FACTS: Navarro cherry-picks a study widely criticized as flawed and ignores multiple studies finding hydroxychloroquine doesn’t help.

Numerous rigorous tests of hydroxychloroquine, including a large one from Britain and one led by the National Institutes of Health, concluded that the anti-malaria drug was ineffective for treating hospitalized coronavirus patients. Fauci leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH.

The Food and Drug Administration also has warned the drug should only be used for the coronavirus in hospitals and research settings because of the risk of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues.

The Henry Ford Health System study that Navarro refers to was an observational look back at how various patients fared. It was not a rigorous test where similar patients are randomly assigned to get the drug or not and where each group is compared later on how they did.

In the study, some people with heart or certain other conditions were not given the drugs, which can cause heart rhythm problems, so those patients were fundamentally different from the group they were compared with. Researchers said they adjusted statistically for some differences, but the many variables make it tough to reach firm conclusions.

Some patients also received other treatments such as steroids and the antiviral drug remdesivir, further clouding any ability to tell whether hydroxychloroquine helped.

The White House said Navarro was not authorized to challenge Fauci with the op-ed and should not have done it. But his points largely reflect ones Trump and others in the White House have made themselves.

MORE ON VIRUS THREAT

TRUMP, on what happened after he restricted travel from China: “Nancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later, and even later than that, and others, too.” - Rose Garden remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: No she wasn’t. This is Trump’s frequent and fanciful account of the House speaker’s visit to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Feb. 24. That day, she visited shops and strolled the streets to counter the hostility some people in the district were encountering over a virus that emanated from China.

On that day, Pelosi said the public should be vigilant about the virus but the city took precautions and “we should come to Chinatown.” Local TV news tracked her visit;. She wasn’t seen dancing and did not call for a “street fair,” as Trump at times has put it. Community spread of the coronavirus had not yet been reported.

As FactCheck.org pointed out, the same day Pelosi went to Chinatown, Trump tweeted: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health (Organization) have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” The CDC is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Two days later, Trump asserted that only 15 people in the U.S. were infected and that number would go down “close to zero.” Instead the numbers exploded. More than 3.6 million Americans have had COVID-19.

Trump has accused Pelosi of being “responsible for many deaths” because of the Chinatown visit. He has denied responsibility for any of the deaths sweeping the country as he has persistently minimized the threat, pushed for reopening and refused to take mask-wearing seriously.

TESTING

TRUMP: “We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: He’s repeating the false notion that anybody who wants a COVID-19 test can get one.

Americans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites. People often are disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if they are tested, they sometimes are forced to wait many days for results.

Julie Khani, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics and other labs, has made clear that “the anticipated demand for COVID-19 testing over the coming weeks will likely exceed members’ testing capacities.” This past week the group encouraged members to give priority to “those most in need, especially hospitalized and symptomatic patients.”

Many governors and local officials say they cannot meet the demand.

“Testing has been a challenge everywhere,” says Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert.

Around Seattle, for instance, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings.

“What’s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,” said Hastings, who is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. “Sometimes we’re not able to test them because we don’t have enough test supplies, so we’re only testing a certain set of patients.”

___

TRUMP: “Cases are up, because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: It’s not true that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased. Trump’s own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.

Increased testing does contribute to the higher numbers, but there’s more to it. Testing in fact has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.

That’s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.

“A high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,” says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.

___

TRUMP: “No country has ever done what we’ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody’s done is our job on testing, because we’re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries; they don’t even do tests. … They don’t go around have massive areas of testing, and we do.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: U.S. testing is not the envy of the world, nor is the U.S. the only country that does mass testing.

U.S. testing on a per capita basis lags other countries that have done a far better job of controlling their outbreaks. State, local and federal officials are warning of the consequences of testing bottlenecks, including tests rendered useless because results come too late.

China has used batch testing, mixing samples and testing them together, as part of a recent campaign to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan. It’s an approach that top U.S. health officials believe could be used to boost U.S. screening, though it’s not clear when pooled testing could become available for wide-scale screenings at U.S. schools and businesses.

“We are nowhere near being able to rein in this virus with the amount of testing we have available at the moment,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.

Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said test results in parts of the U.S. take as long as a week, which is “too long.”

“You do the testing to find out who’s carrying the virus and then quickly get them isolated so they don’t spread it around,” he said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And it’s very hard to make that work when there’s a long delay built in.”

DEATH RATES

TRUMP: “I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.” - Fox interview.

CHRIS WALLACE, host of “Fox News Sunday”: “That’s not true, sir.”

TRUMP: “Number one, low mortality rate.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: Trump’s claim is wholly unsupported.

An accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.

Using a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.

Such calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.

The only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people’s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.

___

TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS

TRUMP: “If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: U.S. health officials actually believe Trump was late in restricting travel from parts of Europe.

While Trump imposed travel restrictions on China in late January, he didn’t follow up with many European countries until mid-March. Those delayed travel alerts as well as limited testing contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We clearly didn’t recognize the full importations that were happening,” Schuchat told The Associated Press in May.

___

TRUMP: “We would’ve had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China. But we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. … By closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives.” - Rose Garden remarks

THE FACTS: He didn’t ban travel from China. He restricted it. Dozens of countries took similar steps to control travel from hot spots before or around the same time the U.S. did.

The U.S. restrictions that took effect Feb. 2 continued to allow travel to the U.S. from China’s Hong Kong and Macao territories over the past five months. The Associated Press reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals based in those territories entered the U.S. in the first three months after the travel restrictions were imposed.

Additionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month after the restrictions took effect. U.S. officials lost track of more than 1,600 of them who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure.

Few doubt that the heavy death toll from COVID-19 would be even heavier if world travel had not been constricted globally. But Trump has no scientific basis to claim that his action alone saved “millions” or even “hundreds of thousands” of lives, as he has put it.

___

TRUMP, on Biden: “He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. ‘Xenophobic,’ he called me. ‘Xenophobic.’ A month later, he admitted I was right.” - Rose Garden.

THE FACTS: No, Biden did not come out against the travel restrictions on China. He said little about them at the time. In April, his campaign said he supported travel restrictions if “guided by medical experts.”

Biden did say Trump has a record of xenophobia, a comment made during an Iowa campaign event when the restrictions were announced. Biden said Trump was “fear-mongering” against foreigners and the Democrat took issue with Trump’s references to the “China virus” as an example. He did not address the travel steps.

Trump has claimed that Biden realized he was right after all about restricting travel from China and wrote him a “letter of apology.” This didn’t happen, either.

___

POLICE

TRUMP: “Biden wants to defund the police.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: To be clear, Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded “defund the police” after George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis. He’s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.

“I don’t support defunding the police,“ Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether “they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.”

Biden’s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for “training that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths” and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.

Specifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.

That adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.

Biden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.

___

ECONOMY

TRUMP: “I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world, until we got hit with the China virus.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: Not true. The economy was healthy back then but not the best in U.S. history, much less world history.

Economic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under President Barack Obama. And while posting great job and stock market numbers, Trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign. The U.S. economy was not the world’s best in history when this started.

___

MILITARY

TRUMP: “I got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.” - Fox interview.

THE FACTS: Trump often boasts about the size of the military pay raises under his administration, but there’s nothing extraordinary about them.

Several raises in the past decade have been larger than service members are getting under Trump - 3.1% this year, 2.6% last year, 2.4% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2017.

Raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, for example, were all 3.4% or more.

Pay increases shrank after that because of congressionally mandated budget caps. Trump and Congress did break a trend that began in 2011 of pay raises that hovered between 1% and 2%.

Rabid bat found in Jefferson County,07-15-2020 00:00,"Breaking News

JEFFERSON COUNTY, Idaho (KIFI/KIDK) - A bat found in the yard of a residence in Rigby/Jefferson County was later identified as having rabies.

While most bats are harmless and do not carry rabies, they are the only animal in Idaho that is a natural reservoir for the virus.

Rabies is a fatal viral illness in humans and other animals. Household pets and other animals can be exposed to the virus by playing with sick bats that can no longer fly normally. This is why it is important for people to make sure that their animals are vaccinated against rabies.

“It is important if you have been bitten, scratched, or have come in close contact with a bat to contact your health care provider immediately,"" Eastern Idaho Public Health (EIPH) epidemiologist Ken Anderson said. ""Rabies is fatal once symptoms appear, but it can be prevented almost 100% of the time when the rabies vaccine and other medical therapies are

administered soon after the exposure occurs.”

"Crowded meeting with few masks ‘foolish,’ Utah governor says",07-16-2020 20:10,"Angry residents react when the Utah County Commission meeting was adjourned before it even started, Wednesday, July 15, 2020, in Provo, Utah. The group protesting against face masks being required in schools removed the social distancing tape on the chairs and filled the Utah County Commission room to over flowing, prompting Commissioner Tanner Ainge to call for a vote to adjourn the meeting. (Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP)

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — People crowding into a public meeting in Utah to push for an exception to mask requirements in schools was “foolish” and suggested an “almost mob mentality” on the issue, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday.

Herbert spoke the day after local officials in Utah County abruptly canceled the meeting because the crowd did not follow social-distancing guidelines meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Utah, like many states, has been experiencing a surge of coronavirus cases in recent months.

The three-member county commissioners had planned to vote on whether to ask for a partial exemption from Herbert’s statewide mask mandate for schools. Attendees at the board meeting in Provo booed after the commissioners opted to push the vote to a later date because of health concerns.

Video footage showed the meeting was packed with people who opposed the mandate, few of whom were wearing masks.

“I think the experts will tell us that’s kind of a foolish action,” Herbert said. “People get caught up in almost a mob mentality … there’s a better way to dialog with leadership.”

Health experts say masks can prevent the spread of the disease by catching respiratory droplets that contain the virus when people exhale or cough. The face coverings are promoted as a key tool in allowing the resumption of economic activity and students’ return to schools.

Critics argue mask mandates overstep government power.

The proposal from Utah County Commissioner Bill Lee would have the county health director ask state officials for a “compassionate exemption” from the mask mandate issued last week by Herbert.

Commissioners Tanner Ainge and Nathan Ivie voted in favor of postponing the meeting. Lee voted against it.

"The 2020 Tokyo Summer Games were supposed to start this weekend. Here’s what was lost, and what might be next.",07-23-2020 00:00,"The building wraps were nothing but window dressing, really.

Literally as tall as a skyscraper and as big as an office building, they could swathe downtown’s most monolithic edifices with the likenesses of some of the USA’s most recognizable winter athletes. Yet when it came to hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, they were just nice, not necessary. So it wasn’t until carefully scrutinizing the budget five months before the opening ceremonies — barely enough time to get the wraps printed and mounted before the world turned its attention to Utah — that the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee decided it could afford to commission 14 of them.

Two weeks later, on Sept. 11, 2001, the world was set on fire.

Suddenly, the idea of holding a massive, global sporting event in the United States appeared less than prudent. Other countries started suggesting they might sit this one out. And then there was the relatively minor yet still looming question of what to do with those building wraps? They couldn’t be returned and there was no place to store 500,000 square feet of mesh, perforated window film and vinyl banners if organizers postponed or canceled the Games.

That’s Tokyo’s situation today — times 1,000. Friday marks the day the 2020 Summer Games were scheduled to open in Japan’s capital city, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced their postponement until 2021, with the hope that by then the virus that has killed more than 615,000 worldwide will be under control. But rescheduling the dates isn’t as simple as just looking at a calendar. It’s more akin to turning back time, with equally messy repercussions.

“I think what Tokyo is facing is probably the most difficult thing any Olympic Games can face because all of their commitments are time-bound,” said Fraser Bullock, the COO and CFO of the organizing committee for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. “So all of these time-bound commitments now have to be unwound. And that’s very expensive.”

How expensive? Cost-of-postponement estimates range from an additional $2.7 billion to $5.7 billion. That’s for an Olympic Games that has already officially overshot its 2013 bid estimate of $7.3 billion by more than $5 billion. Combined, those costs could put Tokyo 2020 alongside London 2012 as the most expensive Summer Games in history, according to a 2016 Oxford study.

How can the delay cost nearly half as much as hosting the Olympics? Consider it the cost of turning back the clock.

Postponement problems

Most Olympic hosts, but not all — we’re looking at you, Rio de Janeiro, Sochi and Athens — build venues and invest in infrastructural improvements with the expectation that they will benefit the region for years to come. For Tokyo, that meant the construction of eight new permanent venues, the last of which was completed in February, and 10 temporary venues as well as the refurbishment of 25 existing facilities.

Nearly all of those, except the temporary structures, were scheduled to begin use by other entities within months after the closing ceremony for the Paralympic Games in mid-August. Now Games organizers must decide whether to allow those events to go on, making the venues less pristine come 2021, or to find other homes for them. Regardless, they will have to relocate events scheduled in those facilities between July 23-Sept. 5, 2021, the new dates for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. And each relocation will no doubt require some form of compensation.

The temporary structures may actually pose more of a conundrum. They were only supposed to last a little more than a month, not an entire year, but the cost of taking them down and putting them up again would likely be more than maintaining them over the next 12 months. The same goes for the tent cities that encircle most venues and were meant to serve as media workrooms, conference rooms, security and medical stations and the like.

Bullock called those “overlays” and said they ate up a massive chunk of the budget for Salt Lake City’s Olympics.

“We built these small cities, and the budget at that point in time was over $100 million,” of a $1.9-$2.5 billion budget, he said. “So this is a very significant effort.”

But wait, there’s more. Contracts signed almost a decade ago, even before organizers submitted their bid to the International Olympic Committee in 2013, must be renegotiated. That includes contracts for approximately 14,000 hotel rooms as well as buses and transportation equipment, grandstands and other seats, tables, generators, warehouses and concessions.

It also includes people. Full-time staff hired for the Games have to be paid for an extra year or let go and then re-trained. Tokyo’s 80,000 volunteers also will have to be retrained and their numbers may have to be expanded to accommodate coronavirus safety protocols.

It’s not all bad news for Tokyo, though. Take the athletes’ village for example. While more than a quarter of the newly built luxury apartments that make up the village have already been sold, ESPN reported that residents aren’t supposed to start moving in until 2023. So, organizers caught a small break there.

Insurance may also help cover costs stemming from the delay in some circumstances (though in Salt Lake’s case, it would only have kicked in if the Games were canceled). Plus, if organizers can pull off the 2021 event the way they have marketed it, as a global celebration of the world moving past the COVID-19 pandemic, then they also stand to bring in a record amount of sponsorship money.

“We can, together with the organizing committee, turn these postponed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 into an unprecedented celebration of unity and solidarity of humankind,” IOC president Thomas Bach said in a speech last week, “making them a symbol of resilience and hope.”

In the grand scheme of things, though, that’s mostly happy talk. When or, rather, if the last firework erupts at the closing ceremony, the Japanese taxpayers will still be on the hook for billions of dollars.

Uncertain future

Bullock’s experience overseeing the 2002 Games gives him unique insight into the headache-inducing issues organizers of the Tokyo Game are wrestling with right now. He remembers how everything paused — ticket sales, sponsor interest, the construction of tent cities around each venue — in the weeks after the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell.

Within a few months, though, balance had been restored. The event’s rapid rebound was a tribute to the organizing committee’s thorough planning, which included preparing contingency plans for about 800 different unforeseen disruptions, among which was a terrorist attack.

“If you have a grade-based plan, then contingency planning builds on that and your team gets to the point where they say, ‘We’re ready for anything,’” Bullock said. “They really have their confidence.”

Yet while they share some similarities, the threat of a terrorist attack and the threat of a deadly virus are obviously different animals. Working with the Secret Service, Salt Lake City’s group beefed up security. Those efforts helped countries with reservations about attending the Games ultimately decide to send their athletes.

But even the Secret Service can’t stop the coronavirus.

For that reason, even with an extra year’s grace, nothing about the Tokyo Games is certain. Will fans be able to attend? Will athletes, coaches, media and personnel from the 206 National Olympic Committees worldwide have to quarantine for two weeks before entering the country? If they do, will the Games be held in a bubble, similar to the one established by the NBA in Florida, with strict penalties for those who leave it? Can the Games even be held?

Bach said last week that an Olympics with no fans is a last resort. Still, it’s preferable to further postponing the Tokyo Games, which he said is not an option. Games or not, after next summer the IOC’s attention will turn to the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022 and the Summer Games in Paris in 2024.

But if the Tokyo Games fall, so might the Beijing Games, scheduled for six months later. Richard Pound, one of the longest sitting IOC members, said during an interview with Reuters last week that the threat of losing both events to the virus is real, especially if no vaccine exists.

“Taking the political side out of it for the moment, say there is a COVID problem in July and August next year in Tokyo,” Pound said. “It is hard to imagine there is not going to be a knock-on effect in the same area five months later.”

Bullock called Pound “very candid and very observant,” but disagreed with his assessment. He said a postponement of those Games would be more likely.

The postponement of a Games has no effect on the Olympic schedule or the dates or sites of future winter or summer events, such as Milano Cortina 2026 or Los Angeles 2028. Once the viable window for an Olympics passes, the IOC has made clear it will cut ties and move onto the next event.

That doesn’t mean those actions don’t pose a threat to the Olympic movement as a whole.

We need to talk

Bullock said the IOC and potential hosts need to begin having detailed conversations about the risks of hosting the Games, who will shoulder them and how. If that doesn’t happen, he expects to see considerably fewer sites willing to host. That could put an abrupt end to resurgence of enthusiasm the IOC had just begun to see after changing its approach to the bid process last year — treating it less like a competition, which invited bribery and corruption, and more as a consultancy.

And what is the future of the Olympics if no one wants to host them?

“It certainly could deter cities,” he said. “I think it’s in the best interest of the entire Olympic movement, whether it’s the IOC or the NOCs or organizing committees or the international federations to come together for some comprehensive planning around the risk.

“This is a risk to the movement overall and all of these parties need to come together to address it so the cities who do want to be considered as future hosts have an answer to this issue.”

Bullock said SLOC took an extremely frugal approach to putting on the 2002 Olympics, and the building wraps are a prime example of that. They weren’t ordered until the organizers knew for certain that they could afford them.

“Six months out from the games, everything looked like it was going to go well. And so we started decorating the city,” he said.

The repercussions of the 9/11 tragedy took away some of that budget cushion, but Salt Lake City 2002 still ended up being one of the few Olympics in history to not lose money on the event.

It’s because of that experience that Bullock said he feels comfortable pursuing another Olympics in Utah in 2030 or 2034. He said he sees considerable value in hosting the Games if they are handled right.

Among the benefits he listed is an infusion of cash into the state for economic development, which he estimates will reach $6 billion the next time Utah hosts the Games. The marketing reach, and its economic shockwaves, also can’t be underestimated, he said. Plus, and he considered this the most compelling reason to bring the Games back, hosting an Olympics gives the locals an unequaled international experience.",https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2020/07/23/tokyo-summer-games-were/,2,Utah,USA,"""Utah"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",

"'Swing County, USA' Prepares For Unprecedented Influx Of Ballots By Mail",,"The county government cafeteria in Northampton County, Pa., is a large, airy room with big windows and, for now, lunch tables separated by plexiglass.

But a few months from now, on Election Day, this is where the county plans to have a couple of dozen people processing what it expects could be 100,000 mail-in ballots, nearly triple what they handled in the June 2 primary and 15 times what they handled in November 2016.

The dramatic rise in mail-in ballots prompted the move of the counting operation to the cafeteria, one of many steps this swing county on the eastern edge of a battleground state is taking to prepare for this unprecedented presidential election.

""We're very supportive of it. It's just a little more work,"" says Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure Jr. ""Based on our experience from the primary, we just don't think it's physically possible to count the potential 100,000 mail-in ballots that day.""

Pennsylvania is among the handful of states that could decide the outcome of the election if it's close. It voted twice for Barack Obama before pivoting to Donald Trump in 2016.

Like many other places across the U.S., officials are anticipating a tremendous increase in the number of people voting by mail, because of changes in laws and coronavirus concerns. While there's little evidence that mail-in ballots are insecure, they do introduce logistical and other challenges.

""Every component piece of the process requires more — more dollars, more space, more staffing, more equipment. And earlier timelines,"" says Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar.

Historically, only about 5% of Pennsylvanians voted absentee. That was already set to change this year, as Pennsylvania joined more than 30 other states in allowing voting by mail for any reason, also known as no-excuse absentee voting.

Gov. Tom Wolf hailed the new law, passed last fall, as ""the biggest change to our elections in generations ... removing barriers to the voting booth and encouraging more people to vote.""

Pennsylvania election officials say they expected a modest increase in mail-in voting in the 2020 primary, the first election under the new rules.

""And then COVID-19 hit,"" says Boockvar.

Statewide, Pennsylvania saw a nearly 18-fold increase in mail-in voting in the June 2 primary, compared with four years ago. Boockvar anticipates that 50% of the state's voters could opt for mail-in voting this fall.

The sheer numbers, along with the complexities of counting mail-in ballots, have raised questions and lowered expectations about how soon there will be results — not just in Pennsylvania but across the country.

For months, President Trump has promoted the false narrative that mail-in voting will lead to fraud and a rigged election. To be clear, though there have been issues as the use of mail-in voting increases — such as ballots rejected for being late or unsigned — election experts say there is no evidence that voting by mail leads to rampant fraud.

But because of how time-consuming the process is, a big question remains: On election night, will voters know who is going to be the next president of the United States?

It's the ""million-dollar question,"" says Boockvar. ""I think that Nov. 3, we may not.""

Boockvar is hoping the Pennsylvania legislature will pass a measure that would allow ballots to be pre-canvassed, starting as early as three weeks before Nov. 3. That process includes opening both a ballot's outer envelope and secondary privacy envelope and confirming the voter's eligibility. Under current law, this work can't start until 7 a.m. on Election Day.

The final step, feeding the ballot into a scanner that counts the vote, would still happen on Election Day under the proposed legislation.

""That last part is the fastest part of the process,"" Boockvar says. ""It's all the other things, including literally the physical extraction of the documents in the envelope, that take a remarkable number of hours and days depending on how many ballots you get back.""

This spring, things actually ran pretty smoothly in Northampton County, where officials proudly point out that they were the first in Pennsylvania to report election results in the June 2 primary, at around 9 p.m.

Still, they say that without the ability to pre-canvass mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day in November, same-day results are unlikely.

""We'll have significant numbers on election night, but we won't be done unless the law changes,"" McClure, the county executive, says.

There is already a lot of interest in how Northampton County will vote come Nov. 3. The county, about 90 minutes from both Philadelphia and New York City, is looked to as a bellwether in presidential elections.

""If you go and look back historically all the way to the early part of the last century, you'd see that the way Northampton County goes, so does Pennsylvania,"" says Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, who lives in the borough of Nazareth, in the center of the county. ""It's really unbelievable as a predictor for the state as a whole.""

Northampton County was one of three Pennsylvania counties that voted twice for Barack Obama before pivoting to Donald Trump. Trump won Pennsylvania by a mere 44,000 votes, a margin of less than 1%.

""We like to call ourselves Swing County, USA,"" says Sam Chen, a Republican strategist and political science professor who grew up in the steel town of Bethlehem, Pa.

Chen, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, says he hasn't decided yet whom he'll support this year, though he's leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden.

One thing Chen has decided is that he will vote by mail, and he's expecting a lot of other Republicans to do the same, despite Trump's attacks on mail-in voting.

""It's going to come down to convenience,"" Chen says. ""Is it easier for me to vote in person?""

Others are more skeptical. Frank DeVito, an attorney and one of two Republicans on the Northampton County Election Commission, says Trump's rhetoric railing against mail-in voting is resonating with Republican voters. In recent weeks, for instance, Trump has claimed without evidence that millions of ballots could be printed by foreign countries.

""Is it possible what he's saying? I mean, yeah, in theory,"" says DeVito, speaking at his home in Bath, Pa., with a ""Trump-Pence 2020"" sign in his front yard. ""Theoretically, when anybody who's a registered voter can mail a ballot in and never show up at a polling place, never sign in, it's more likely that you can commit fraud.""

""On how wide of a scale is something like that going to happen?"" DeVito continues. ""It's likely that there will be a few paper ballots mailed to the wrong addresses and somebody will just use it. But on a systemic, widespread level, I really don't know. I think it's a real possibility.""

There were already notable differences in how Republicans and Democrats chose to vote in Northampton County's June primary.

Among Democrats, 26,440 voted by mail, versus 10,051 who voted at the polls. Compare that with Republicans: 10,367 voted by mail, with 15,582 voting at the polls.

Northampton County Executive McClure, a Democrat, wants to get the word out that either form of voting is fine.

""It appears that Republicans prefer to vote in person, and we've got a great system for them, and they know their votes are going to count,"" McClure says. ""And it appears Democrats prefer to vote by mail at this juncture.""

As the county election staff members await word on whether they will be able to pre-canvass the mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day, they're already in better shape than they were for the primary. They have purchased a third high-speed envelope-opening machine, known as an enveloper, which can slice open 24,000 envelopes per hour.

McClure says he has great confidence in the technology, in the backup systems and in the people running them.

""I'd die before I let this election be rigged,"" he says. ""There are some things that are greater in importance than a partisan victory: the sanctity and integrity of our elections.""

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

Will we know who won the presidency by the end of the night on November 3? Well, here's what we heard when we put that question to people either directly involved with or closely tracking the vote in Pennsylvania.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Million-dollar question (laughter).

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I would probably say no.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That's a valid question. The answer might be no.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Not confident.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I think that we may not.

KELLY: Pennsylvania is among the handful of states that could decide the outcome of the election if it's close. It was a battleground state in 2016, too. Trump won but barely - a margin of less than 1%. This November Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar told me she expects a sea change in the number of Pennsylvanians casting their ballots by mail.

KATHY BOOCKVAR: I would expect that we would probably see about 50% cast by mail.

KELLY: Wow - 50%. I mean, it's stunning.

BOOCKVAR: It is stunning considering we've historically been 5%.

KELLY: Now, while there's little evidence that mail ballots are not secure, they can take longer to count. So what are the implications of that? What if results are delayed by days, even weeks? We wanted to see how Pennsylvania is preparing, so we hopped in the car and pointed north up I-95.

And we just crossed the state line crossing from Delaware over into Pennsylvania.

Keep heading north, and you arrive at the part of Pennsylvania where we're going to spend these next minutes - the Lehigh Valley, Northampton County. We're here because in a key swing state, this is a key swing region. Politically, it's about as purple as you can get - one of just three counties in the whole state that went for Barack Obama twice then swung to Trump.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: So I'm calling the meeting to order.

KELLY: We've just pulled up to the outdoor meeting of the Democratic Women of Nazareth and Vicinity, a couple dozen women spread out and socially distanced on park benches, everybody wearing masks.

UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.

KELLY: It's their first meeting since the pandemic hit. They tell us the virus makes it tough to knock on doors, so they are kicking off a postcard campaign. And they are focused - really focused - on the possibilities of voting by mail.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Can I just have a show of hands of how many people already have registered to get their mail-ins?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: For November?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: For November.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I tried to get on, and they said they...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Votepa.com.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: OK.

KELLY: Here's the thing. You used to have to give a reason if you wanted to vote by mail in Pennsylvania. That law changed last year. So election officials were expecting a modest increase in mail ballots for 2020. Then came the coronavirus. This spring, as the primary loomed, poll workers quit. They were worried about getting sick. Voters were worried about getting sick. Pennsylvania postponed its April primary, and by the time they held it last month, record numbers of ballots poured in by mail.

AMY HESS: This is our new office.

KELLY: Amy Hess, deputy registrar of elections for Northampton County - she's giving us a tour around the county government offices in Easton.

HESS: So this is our locked ballot room with a security camera.

KELLY: Offices which they have had to reconfigure given the unique challenges of 2020. Hess shows us where they set up tables on primary day to accommodate all the workers slicing open envelopes, extracting the ballot.

HESS: What took the longest was unfolding it and flattening it out.

KELLY: Now, in Northampton County, primary day went pretty smoothly according to county executive Lamont McClure.

LAMONT MCCLURE: We were the first county in Pennsylvania to have our complete results in.

KELLY: Really?

MCCLURE: Yes.

KELLY: Results in by 9 p.m. But on November 3 they are bracing for a tsunami - a hundred thousand mail in ballots in this county alone. Under current state law, counties cannot start confirming voter eligibility or start opening envelopes until the morning of Election Day. There is a push for the state legislature to change that in these next few weeks, a change which McClure - a Democrat - told me would make a big difference.

MCCLURE: Based on our experience from the primary, we just don't think it's physically possible to count the potential 100,000 mail-in ballots that day.

KELLY: Now, McClure is talking about a delay of hours in reporting results. But it is worth injecting here in other parts of Pennsylvania, there are still races from the June 2 primary where we don't yet have an official winner. So imagine a scenario where days, a week after the presidential election, votes are being counted, lawsuits are being filed and questions are being asked about the legitimacy of the election. This is a scenario being fed by the man trying to win reelection. The president has tweeted inaccurately about widespread mail-in ballot fraud and warned of a rigged 2020 election and that results could be delayed for months. I asked Lamont McClure if he's worried.

MCCLURE: We're not worried about fraud at all, and we're not worried about a rigged election in Northampton County. I would - I'm a Democrat. I'm going to be for Joe Biden. I'd die before I let this election be rigged.

FRANK DEVITO: Is President Trump's - is it possible what he's saying? Yeah, in theory. I mean, I think it's easier...

KELLY: This is Frank DeVito - attorney, Republican, member of the Northampton County Election Commission - a Trump Pence 2020 sign planted in his front yard. His toddler children came out to greet us, and then we sat at a picnic table, a rooster crowing from the next yard over. DeVito agrees there is no evidence that voting by mail leads to massive fraud. But he plans to vote in person, and he is sympathetic to the president's view that doing otherwise creates problems.

DEVITO: If you show up physically, you sign a paper, you vote, the chain of custody is very limited. But when things are going out to a mailbox and then back to the voter registration office sometimes weeks before the election and then more of them come in on Election Day that are being dropped off in boxes at the courthouse - the county is doing their best. It's not a free-for-all where just mail-in ballots are going to go disappearing in suitcases. I certainly don't think so. So I would give reassurances, but I would give guarded reassurances that I still think there are a lot more holes in the system.

KELLY: For the record, again, there is no proof that mail ballots have posed significant threat to election security. But public trust can be fragile. The perception of chaos can be as damaging and as polarizing as actual chaos. The local Democratic Party is already busy trying to manage expectations, pumping out the message on social media that it may take a while to know who won in Pennsylvania and the most important thing is to get an accurate count. I was curious if that message is resonating and, just generally, what's on voters' minds here - so one more stop.

We've pulled up now to Bethlehem, one of the cities in Northampton County, making our way down Main Street, which is so pretty - old, historic, brick sidewalks, benches out, people sitting on them, eating ice cream.

We walked up and down Main Street, talking with people for a while. And then we got lucky because if you were trying to capture the diversity of political views in this corner of Pennsylvania, you could not do better than these two adjacent tables on a shady sidewalk outside the Spanish tapas bar and restaurant.

ABIGAIL ILLINGWORTH: Hey there. Hi.

KELLY: Can we say hi? We are journalists from NPR.

At the table farther from the curb, Abigail Illingworth - she's from Hellertown, another town nearby, about to start senior year in college. This is her first time voting in a presidential election.

This is quite an election to have it be your first one.

ILLINGWORTH: It sure is. Yeah, it sure is (laughter).

KELLY: Who are you voting for?

ILLINGWORTH: I do believe I will be going with Biden.

KELLY: For Biden.

ILLINGWORTH: Yes.

KELLY: Can you give me a sense why?

ILLINGWORTH: I just do not agree with President Trump's policies or beliefs whatsoever - any of them.

KELLY: Illingworth dismisses the president's warnings of fraud and a rigged election, and she's appalled at his handling of the pandemic. Trump's long refusal to wear a mask, she says, sets a very poor example. Just a few feet away, polishing off what looked like a tiny tostada sat Iliana. She declined to give her last name for privacy reasons. She's 39 years old, works at one of the big hospitals in the Lehigh Valley, also a Trump voter.

ILIANA: I feel like he is the only president that is come in not as a politician and more of a businessman and more aware of trying to protect the economy as well as trying to limit some of the drug trafficking that's coming - going on in America as well. I definitely think that the media portrays him to be more of a bad person than he actually is.

KELLY: What about the pandemic, I asked. What do you make of how he's handled it?

ILIANA: I definitely think that, you know, it is something to be concerned about. But at the same time, I do think that the media is portraying it to be a lot bigger than what it is.

KELLY: After that, Iliana circled back a third time in our short interview to what she sees as unfair reporting on the president - fake news. On the next block under a wide green awning with Johnny's Bagel and Deli spelled across it, we'd arranged to meet Samuel Chen, GOP staffer-turned-consultant. He used to work for former Republican Gov. John Kasich, former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent and others. He has never voted for a Democrat at the top of the ticket before, but...

SAMUEL CHEN: I consider myself an undecided Republican voter who, in the moment, is leaning toward Vice President Biden.

KELLY: Leaning but not quite there yet. He wants to see who Biden picks as his running mate. Chen grew up near here. Over iced coffees, we talked about the region's reputation as a bellwether for the rest of the state and Pennsylvania's outsized role in the national outcome.

CHEN: I think the election swings on people like me and on these undecideds because we know how Texas is going to go. We know how California is going to go. We're looking at a handful of states and a handful of voters in those states.

KELLY: Chen communicated something I sensed from other people we interviewed here - the weight of responsibility they feel for making sure Pennsylvania doesn't blow it on November 3.

CHEN: Now you have the mail-in issue. There is a lot of concern among election officials, Republican and Democrat, of making sure we get this right. And how do we make sure we don't call it too early and have to retract it? But how do we make sure we're not a month afterwards and the whole country is saying, hey, Pennsylvania. Do you have election result yet? - especially if it swings on this state.

KELLY: The worst-case scenario, Sam Chen says - what happened in Florida in 2000 but updated for the Twitter era and unfolding during a pandemic. For those who need a refresher, in 2000 - Bush versus Gore - Americans waited 36 days to learn who'd won.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOEY PECORARO'S ""HERE WE ARE AGAIN"") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.upr.org/post/swing-county-usa-prepares-unprecedented-influx-ballots-mail,6,Utah,USA,"""Utah"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert and the rift between them,,"Donovan Mitchell says he and Rudy Gobert are back on good terms after they both tested positive for COVID-19 back in March. (0:39)

THE DAY AFTER Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, triggering the suspension of the NBA season, the Utah Jazz center tried to get in touch with his co-star, Donovan Mitchell. Gobert had just learned that Mitchell was the only other member of the team's 58-person traveling party to test positive.

Gobert called Mitchell on March 12, then texted and later direct-messaged him on Instagram. Mitchell didn't respond.

Earlier that afternoon, Gobert had apologized in an Instagram post to the people he had potentially exposed to the virus, calling his behavior ""careless."" Two days before his positive result, the 7-foot-1 Frenchman touched all the microphones and recording devices in front of him at a news conference, jokingly mocking the NBA's new physical distancing media policies. Gobert's hunch that Mitchell was upset with him was soon confirmed by a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

Mitchell acknowledged during a ""Good Morning America"" appearance four days after his positive test that ""it took me a while to kind of cool off,"" but he avoided the question about whether he had been in touch with Gobert.

Utah's franchise cornerstones went weeks without any communication, and Mitchell didn't comment again publicly until July 2. The silence fueled speculation about whether the Jazz would have to choose between their All-Stars, even if people within the organization considered the rift between Mitchell and Gobert overblown, believing it could have been managed relatively easily if they had to be in the same locker room.

There had long been friction between the two, the kind typical with NBA duos, particularly if those star players are relatively early in their careers -- and especially in a roller-coaster season such as this one for the Jazz, who have basically played .500 ball aside from a 19-2 run in December and January. One high-ranking Jazz source categorized the pre-pandemic issues between the 28-year-old Gobert and Mitchell, 23, as ""a 2 out of 10 on the NBA drama scale.""

But when their strained relationship following the positive tests lingered in public view for months, it increased the intensity of their issues and put a spotlight on an already-tense dynamic. It's a spotlight that was created because, according to sources, Mitchell blamed Gobert for infecting him with COVID-19.

""You know, I tried to put myself in his shoes,"" Gobert told ESPN. ""There was a lot of fear, and I think more than anything, he reacted out of fear. That's why I don't really blame him. We all have different character; we all react differently. When it's something like that, when he tested [positive] for a virus that we don't know a lot about, it's scary. It was scary for me, and I'm sure it was scary for him.

""The most important thing is what you do from there.""

Joe Ingles, a respected veteran whose wry sense of humor is often an important element of the Jazz's chemistry, privately told them several weeks into the hiatus that it would be selfish and hurt their teammates if the stars held grudges against each other.

The Jazz wanted to start virtual team meetings and workouts, but Gobert told teammates in early April that he wouldn't feel right participating until he had a discussion with Mitchell. A month into the NBA hiatus, Gobert and Mitchell talked.

""We told each other what we had to say to each other,"" Gobert said. ""We are both on the same page. We both want to win. We both think that we have a great opportunity, and we know that we need each other. We talked about a lot of things, but the main thing was that we are on the same page and the fact that our team needs us. We can win together. That's the most important thing.""

When Mitchell spoke on July 2, he said he was ready to move on.

""Right now, we're good,"" Mitchell said in a virtual news conference with reporters. (He declined requests to comment for this story through his agent.) ""We're going out there ready to hoop.""

That aligned with Gobert's feelings about moving forward.

""The virus or not, it's never perfect,"" Gobert said. ""Relationships are never perfect. The most important thing is to have respect for one another.""

Both Mitchell and Gobert are in line for big raises, and the team plans to keep building around them. But amid the public revelation of these long-simmering tensions, the Jazz face a question: Is the future of the organization secure in the hands of two players who aren't friendly with each other?

After Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert became the first two NBA players to test positive for the coronavirus, their relationship was put under the microscope. Soobum Im/USA TODAY Sports

GOBERT HAD JUST put the finishing touches on one of his most dominant performances, an 18-point, 25-rebound, two-block, plus-20 outing in a Jan. 14, 2019, home win over the Detroit Pistons. He had dominated two-time All-Star center Andre Drummond for the team's sixth win in seven games, a couple of weeks before the coaches made their selections for All-Star reserves. Jazz TV sideline reporter Kristen Kenney corralled Gobert for the postgame interview, which played over the speakers at Vivint Smart Home Arena.

Midway through the interview, Gobert's attention was diverted by Mitchell, who often playfully interrupts teammates' postgame TV hits, sometimes squirting them with water. As a smiling Mitchell sneaked up from behind and made some silly sounds, Gobert looked over his left shoulder and delivered a one-liner into the microphone:

""Hey, pass the ball, goddamn it!""

Mitchell, who had 28 points on 21 shots and two assists, laughed and turned toward the tunnel to the Jazz locker room, altering his path to give high-fives to a couple of kids in the courtside seats who were wearing his No. 45 jersey.

It was a moment that made many within the Jazz organization uncomfortable. They knew Gobert's quip contained a lot of truth about his feelings on Mitchell's passing.

Gobert rarely hesitates to let teammates know if they miss him when he is open around the rim. He'll occasionally point up during play in animated fashion, sometimes as he is running back on defense, to note that a lob should have been thrown. He'll often air his gripes verbally, during games and again in film sessions.

""Rudy has to pick his spots, and Donovan can't react to everything. Sometimes you have to play chess and appease your teammates. ... Is it about you trying to prove your point to one another or us trying to win?""

Mitchell hears it the most, simply because as the Jazz's go-to guy, he has the ball in his hands the most. That, according to several Jazz sources, has been the primary irritant in an overall successful partnership.

""If you take a paper towel and just drip water on it, the paper towel is going to get moist and then it's going to get damp and eventually it's going to break,"" a Jazz source said. ""Rudy has to pick his spots, and Donovan can't react to everything. Sometimes you have to play chess and appease your teammates.

""It's not about being right all the time. Sometimes it's like, 'It happened and let's move on.' Is it about you trying to prove your point to one another or us trying to win?""

Gobert acknowledges that Mitchell and other Jazz teammates have passed him the ball a lot, considering he set an NBA record in 2018-19 for the most dunks in a season since shot types started being recorded in 2000.

Gobert also understands that whether he is right often is irrelevant if the tone and timing of his delivery are off-putting, something frequently stressed by Jazz assistant coach Alex Jensen, whose blunt, direct approach has guided Gobert's development from skinny project to one of the NBA's premier big men. Gobert knows his lobbying for lobs wears on teammates to the point of being counterproductive, like the wide receiver who gripes at the quarterback after every play when a pass isn't thrown his way, regardless of the pass rush.

""I understand that I'm annoying. I can be very annoying,"" said Gobert, adding that he knows Mitchell's job is difficult as the focal point of defenses. ""I think maybe because he was really good really early, I've been very demanding and maybe in not always a positive way. Sometimes you don't realize it.

""Like with me, people can be hard on me and I can handle it, but for some guys, it can become very frustrating. I can understand that 100 percent. Donovan has gotten better every year since he's gotten here. I think he's going to keep getting a lot better. It's pretty much, I'm the a--hole.""

GOBERT INSISTS THAT the reason he is so demanding of his teammates, and Mitchell in particular, is that he is so proud of what the Jazz have built during his career that he refuses to lower his standards.

Utah won 25 games during Gobert's rookie season, when he spent much of his time in the then D-League, and the Jazz didn't finish with a winning record or make the playoffs until his fourth campaign. Their lone All-Star, Gordon Hayward, bolted for the Boston Celtics in free agency weeks after that first postseason taste. But after getting a glimpse of Mitchell tearing up the summer leagues, Gobert boldly declared that the Jazz would be just as good without their departed leading scorer.

Gobert was unexpectedly proved right when Mitchell showed within the first month of his career that he was capable of carrying a heavier offensive burden in the NBA than he did at Louisville, a role much larger than the Jazz anticipated when they traded up to select him with the 13th pick of the 2017 draft.

Mitchell, who is the son of a New York Mets executive and considered baseball his main sport until he was 16, readily acknowledges that he is still learning on the fly as a primary playmaker. He often says making reads is the area of his game that requires the most work. There also are times when he tries to do too much, common for young stars.

""Sometimes he'll try to be the hero and take big shots,"" a Jazz source said. ""I know he wants to be the guy, but sometimes the play is right in front of you and he needs to pass the ball. He has to grow in that area and trust his teammates more.""

Utah coach Quin Snyder and his staff have attempted to help facilitate that trust, especially between Mitchell and Gobert. That duo have had dozens of two-man workouts under the watch of coaches, with a focus on ironing out intricacies of their pick-and-roll partnership and lob chemistry. They also occasionally join coaches -- usually some combination of Snyder, Jensen and Johnnie Bryant, the assistant who works most with Mitchell -- for small-group film sessions at the team's facility.

Those sessions typically -- perhaps fittingly -- take place in either the Stockton Room or the Malone Room. The rooms, located next to each other, are decorated with photos of John Stockton and Karl Malone, further honoring the legends whose statues sit outside the arena near the intersection of the streets named after them.

It's another reminder of the high standard for teamwork in Utah, lessons the young stars are still learning.

""It's all about how we learn to try to have empathy for one another,"" Gobert said. ""The best teams, it's never perfect, but you understand your strengths and you understand how to make each other better. You want to make each other better.""

In recent comments, both Gobert and Mitchell mentioned the Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant partnership that produced three titles for the Los Angeles Lakers as proof that co-stars don't have to necessarily be friends to be successful. (They also both noted that they weren't trying to compare themselves to the legends in terms of talent or production.)

""For us, it's like, there's going to be tension,"" said Mitchell, who was adamant that their long-uneasy relationship didn't influence his reaction toward Gobert after testing positive for the coronavirus. ""There's going to be back-and-forth. Obviously, I feel like I should be right here, he feels like he should be right there. But it's always going to happen. It happens on every team ...

""So I feel like in a work environment, you're not going to always get along or go out to eat and hang out with your teammates. So that's that.""

JAZZ COACHES CONSIDER the screen assist -- crediting a player for setting a pick that leads directly to a teammate's basket -- a gift from the stat geeks.

It's been available on the NBA's stats site since the start of the 2016-17 season. Gobert has ranked first or tied for first in screen assists in each of those seasons.

It's tangible evidence that Gobert is the best in the game at something that had long fallen under the category of an intangible, a way of helping teammates score that is rarely noticed by casual fans and never appears in a traditional box score.

""I just think it helps my team win, and if it does, I'm going to keep doing it,"" Gobert said.

Publicly and privately, Gobert constantly emphasizes that winning is his top priority. He embraces doing the dirty work necessary to achieve that goal -- but also craves the recognition for doing so.

Gobert is a back-to-back NBA Defensive Player of the Year, but the Jazz big man knows Mitchell's game resonates more with fans. ""He's more fun to watch than me. ... I totally understand how it works, and I'm fine with it,"" Gobert said. Gary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports

It's no secret that being snubbed for a couple of All-Star Games really stung Gobert. He believed he had earned a spot, a contention supported by advanced statistics; he has ranked among the NBA's top four players in win shares in three of the past four seasons, the lone exception being when injuries limited him to 56 games in 2016-17. Gobert memorably teared up the day after All-Star reserves were announced in 2019 -- and he wasn't included -- while discussing his mother's disappointment at a post-practice media availability.

That's why some within the Jazz organization wonder whether Gobert has subconsciously allowed his motivation and relationships to be muddied by his thirst for status -- and, by extension, statistics.

""I can totally see that,"" Gobert said, referring to concern that he had started caring too much about scoring.

""The thing is, it's a paradox, because I play every game to win. I compete every single possession to win. Of course you want accomplishments. You want legacy. When you realize that you help your team win and you're still not selected ...""

Gobert's voice trailed off mid-sentence. Those snubs still sting, even after he made his All-Star debut along with Mitchell this season, adding to a list of honors headlined by two All-NBA selections and two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards.

""When you want to be the best at your position, the best at what you do, you want the accolades that go with it,"" Gobert continued. ""When you do your best to help your team win, your team is winning, and then you get snubbed for people that get better numbers that don't win as much or maybe don't have the same impact, then it's like, what do I need to do more?""

That, Gobert added, certainly doesn't make him an exception. As he put it, ""every single player in the NBA thinks about his stats.""

That desire for acknowledgement -- or to prove doubters wrong -- has been a driving force in Gobert's ascent. He wears No. 27 as a constant reminder that he slid to the 27th pick in the 2013 draft. A scroll through his likes on Twitter reveals an NBA star who searches for both disrespect and praise as fuel. It's also why the Jazz strength coaches don't include upper-body work in Gobert's weightlifting program, knowing he'll get those reps in for the sake of shirtless selfie posts on Instagram.

Some close to Gobert believe this blend of insecurity and vanity is rooted in his experience growing up in France as a gangly kid with glasses.

""Part of it is he's always trying to overcome being that goofy kid in high school,"" a Jazz source said. ""It's that constant never enough, which is good, but it's also been bad.""

It's against that backdrop that Mitchell's marketing success and popularity, particularly as compared to that of Gobert, are seen by some in Utah as sensitive subjects. It can be categorized more as an awareness than a concern in the organization, but there have been cringes when a SportsCenter highlight package focuses on a Mitchell dunk or two after Gobert dominated in a Jazz win.

""If I was 12 years old, I wouldn't want to be watching f---ing Rudy Gobert. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell.""

Gobert, however, insists he doesn't mind that Mitchell has a signature shoe deal with Adidas and a Stance Socks shop in a Salt Lake City mall -- the sort of marketing opportunities beyond Gobert's reach.

""He's the governor, not the mayor,"" one source joked about Mitchell, who plays to Utah fans by asking for tips on finding good Fourth of July barbecues or high school basketball games, then showing up.

Gobert sees the same thing in Mitchell that the marketing executives do -- a charismatic young star with a flashy game, a polish developed while attending prestigious New England prep schools, the cachet of winning the Slam Dunk Contest as a rookie and the powerhouse Creative Artists Agency pushing his brand.

But Gobert also sees Mitchell's dedication to working on his game behind the scenes.

""Obviously, a lot of things happened really fast for him, but I don't think he ever lost track of what's really important,"" the big man said.

If Mitchell is seen as the face of the Jazz franchise, Gobert is adamant it's just fine with him.

""I don't mind Donovan being in the spotlight more than I am,"" Gobert said. ""I want to win games. That's it. At the end of the day, it's not like I [don't] have any spotlight.

""Donovan has a very bright personality and all that, and the way he plays, he's more fun to watch than me,"" Gobert added. ""If I was 12 years old, I wouldn't want to be watching f---ing Rudy Gobert. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell. I wouldn't want to watch Rudy Gobert get dunks and alter shots. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell cross people up and do crazy layups, crazy dunks, of course.

""I totally understand how it works, and I'm fine with it.""

EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT of basketball operations Dennis Lindsey and the rest of the Jazz front office certainly don't see any need to entertain thoughts of choosing between Gobert or Mitchell. Both players have committed to move forward together, both in conversations between the players and the ownership group, front office, coaching staff and with their teammates.

""This isn't, 'Whose team is it?' like Steph Marbury and Kevin Garnett in Minnesota,"" a Jazz source said. ""This is trying to figure out how to win. The things that bind them together is they're both competitive as hell, they both want to win and they both know they need each other.""

The decision to give Mitchell, who has a year remaining on his rookie contract, a maximum deal before he can test restricted free agency qualifies as a no-brainer.

Gobert's looming contract negotiations are likely to be more complicated, as he is a potential 2021 unrestricted free agent eligible for a supermax extension this summer, which could put a small-market franchise in a financial crunch. But the Jazz have been clear that they plan to build around the pair for the foreseeable future. Nothing that has happened since March 11, when their game in Oklahoma City was called off seconds before the scheduled tip, has altered that thinking.

""As we've stated before, we're looking to add players with the physical talent and the competitive makeup of Donovan and Rudy,"" Lindsey said. ""By definition, we want to build around them moving forward.""

There's even hope within the organization that this saga could lead Gobert and Mitchell, who are neighbors in the home locker room but don't often socialize outside of team dinners and outings, to have more productive conversations with each other.

""When adversity comes, it can pull the group together or it can push them away,"" a team source said. ""That's the reality of the situation. It's up to them.""

Mitchell expressed regret that the attention his rift with Gobert generated ""took away from what the guys on the team were trying to do"" and said moving forward he wishes and believes that the Jazz will ""focus on the team as a whole.""

Asked why he didn't address the dynamic with Gobert publicly for 3½ months, whether via social media or in an interview, Mitchell said his initial feelings were no secret and he didn't see value in trying to shoot down a report from The Athletic that quoted an anonymous source describing the situation as ""unsalvageable.""

""We know what it is internally as a team, and that should be it,"" Mitchell said. ""That's part of that maturity and growing up. I could have easily gone back and forth with whoever on Twitter and kind of addressed it, but I'm just like, you know what, there's no need for that. My teammates and my coaches know how I feel, and I feel like that was over with. That's it, and I'm leaving it at that.""

There isn't an expectation that Gobert and Mitchell will suddenly form a close friendship. But that isn't necessary for the Jazz co-stars -- completely different personalities but complementary on-court pieces -- to continue as one of the NBA's most productive duos.

""I think we can accomplish some great things, so that's the moral of the story,"" Gobert said. ""It's never going to be perfect. Sometimes we're going to be very happy, and sometimes we're going to be frustrated with each other.

""But as long as we, as men, respect each other and keep things between him and myself, and approach it as men, we're going to be fine.""",https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them,2,Utah,USA,"""Utah"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
USA Today: Navarro’s anti-Fauci column didn’t meet standards,07-16-2020 16:16,"FILE – White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who is now serving as national defense production act policy coordinator, speaks in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington on April 2, 2020. USA Today says that Navarro’s column about Dr. Anthony Fauci that it solicited and published did not meet its fact-checking standards. Navarro’s column, saying that the nation’s top infectious disease expert had been wrong about everything he had interacted with him on, ran in Wednesday’s newspaper and online a night earlier.

NEW YORK (AP) — USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.

The newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro’s column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday’s newspaper.

Navarro wrote that Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, “has been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.”

The newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check storyby Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro’s claims.

It wasn’t clear how Navarro’s column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he’s letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last monththat an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn’t been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor.

Navarro did not immediately return a message for comment.

USA Today said it had sought Navarro’s opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci “a national treasure.”

That editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint “shows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.”

It wasn’t clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.

Fauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he’s publicly been more pessimistic than the president. He does webcasts but rarely gives television interviews anymore.

Trump distanced himself from Navarro’s column, saying Wednesday that the column was Navarro’s views and “he shouldn’t be doing that.”

Navarro claimed in the column that Fauci opposed travel restrictions from China that were imposed by Trump that “might well have saved hundreds of thousands of American lives.” USA Today said there isn’t enough data to conclude the restrictions made a significant difference, and that despite some initial skepticism, Fauci backed the president.

The fact-checker also gave more context to Navarro claims about masks, the drug hydroxychloroquine and Fauci’s early statements of concern about the virus.",https://www.wnct.com/news/politics/usa-today-navarros-anti-fauci-column-didnt-meet-standards/,0,Utah,USA,"""Utah"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
The Perfect Weekend Getaway: Moab From Denver,06-24-2020 14:36,"Our new series on weekend road trips aims to inspire you for what's to come as we slowly return to travel.

Covid-19 Disclaimer: Make sure to check the status of the states, regions, and establishments in which you’re planning to visit prior to travel. Many regions continue to see high infection rates and deaths, while many states and counties remain under varying stay-at-home orders. Those traveling from areas with high rates of Covid-19 should consider avoiding travel for now in order to reduce spread.

With two national parks just 30 minutes from each other, Moab is Utah’s basecamp for adventure. One of the Southwest’s greatest landscapes, many of the desert playground’s most sought-after views are accessible to the casual traveler, but for intrepid adventurers looking to challenge themselves and get off the grid, there’s plenty of backcountries to get wonderfully lost in as well.

GETTING THERE

An easy five-and-a-half-hour drive due west, the route from Denver takes you past scenic mountain towns like Breckenridge, Vail, and Glenwood Springs on I-70. You’ll continue through Grand Junction until you reach the Utah border where you’ve basically made it.

INSIDER TIP Stop in Palisade, Colorado’s secret wine region to pick up provisions en route.

DAY 1

If you leave early enough, you should arrive by mid-afternoon and can stop at Moab Brewery to fuel up. The town’s largest restaurant and only microbrewery and distillery, it’s basic pub fare (i.e. burgers and wings) and a good spot to try some of the local spirits. Their signature pour, Dead Horse Ale, takes its name from the popular viewpoint and should get you amped up and ready to explore.

If you’re not too tired of being in the car, the Canyonlands Loop at sunset is simply stunning. Canyonlands National Park is much bigger than Arches (almost five times the size), and yet sees about half the number of tourists. It’s more spread out, which makes touring a challenge, but does have an easy 34-mile drive loop to some of the highlights such as Island in the Sky. Snap some photos, do a short hike or two, and stretch your legs before heading to your hotel to freshen up.

When you’re ready, head back out to the main drag for dinner. Antica Forma is the town’s beloved Italian joint and just the carb-fest you need to prep for tomorrow’s activities. Known for their wood-fired pizzas made in and flown all the way from Naples, they have traditional red pies and more unique toppings like pistachio. Hit the hay early because you’ll need to rest up for tomorrow’s festivities.

DAY 2

Grab a coffee and breakfast burrito from Love Muffin Café, plus a panini or some snacks for the road. Since you’ll be out most of the day, you’ll want to pack sustenance and enough water for a day in the desert.

Home to more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, Arches National Park is the gem of the national park system. Your first stop is one you’ll recognize from the Utah license plate. Delicate Arch is the park’s most iconic hike and a must-see, which you can view from afar at the .5 miles Upper Viewpoint or up close on the 3-mile trail.

For a more challenging trek, Devils Garden Loop will take you to a handful of the park’s most prominent arches in 1.9-7.9 miles. They each have varying degrees of difficulty and altitude gain, so plan accordingly and know your endurance level. It can take most of the day if you’re keen on covering a lot of ground.

If you plan well enough in advance, Fiery Furnace is another coveted adventure in Arches National Park. Reservations and permits are required to hike this naturally formed rock labyrinth. You’ll either have to go with a guide or watch a video at the ranger station to learn how to maneuver your way out of the twists and turns of this intriguing canyon maze that has no trails or markers.

You can spend the full day at Arches, but if you’d rather beat the heat, river trips are also extremely popular. Full-day or half-day whitewater excursions down the Colorado and Westwater Canyon range in difficulty from class II-V. Whether you’re looking for a lazy day on the water or roaring rapids, whitewater rafting in Moab is another summer must.

After a long day of exploring, head to Moab Garage for a sweet treat. Their liquid nitrogen ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, and donuts are the perfect mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Looking as much like a science experiment as a snack, the cold feels great after a long day in the blazing sun.

Once you’ve showered and cleaned up, stake out a seat at Blu Pig patio, which boasts barbecue and blues. With live music seven nights a week, it’s undoubtedly the town gathering place. Cooked slow and low, tender ribs and tri-tip taste even better to a soundtrack of reckless abandon before you tuck in for the evening.

DAY 3

You have time for one more half-day excursion, so make it count. Mountain biking, rock climbing, canyoneering, and ATV tours are all wildly popular ways to explore the insane scenery, which makes it a bit of a choose your own adventure.

Give canyoneering a try, as it’s a sport so uniquely attuned to the landscape you just can’t do it anywhere else. Essentially the opposite of rock climbing, by the laws of physics, what goes up, must come down. Rappelling, scrambling, and wading through the slot canyons over waterfalls, it’s an amazing, surprisingly less technical adventure suitable for just about any fitness level.

Once you’ve dried off and packed up, mingle over one last meal before you head back. Open since the ’60s, Moab Diner is the quintessential roadside cafe that can satisfy any carb craving. From big juicy burgers to runny eggs, splurge on a malt, brown butter sundae, or banana split before hitting the road in time to make it back for dinner.

WHERE TO STAY

Most of the area hotels are basic, no-frills crash pads, so many people choose to save their money and camp. If that’s not your thing, the Sorrel River Ranch is the ultimate splurge. As the only luxury resort in Moab, expect the custom-built ranch cabins, signature spa services, and privately guided excursions.

For a more accessible place to rest your head, the Castle Valley Inn Bed and Breakfast is a delightful little hideaway with homemade pastries, beautiful grounds, and a garden hot tub to soak in the views.

WHEN TO GO

Spring and fall are peak seasons in Moab as the weather is more attuned to outdoor activities. Summertime can see temperatures soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes desert explorations difficult. Winter can be an intriguing time to visit as the crowds have subsided, albeit many of the hikes do get icy.",https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/utah/moab-and-southeastern-utah/experiences/news/the-perfect-weekend-getaway-moab-from-denver,1,Utah,USA,"""Utah"", USA AND (""covid"" OR ""coronavirus"") AND (""delay"" OR ""close"")",
'Fang'tastic: researchers report amphibians with snake-like dental glands,07-24-2020 00:00,"LOGAN, UTAH, USA - Utah State University biologist Edmund 'Butch' Brodie, Jr. and colleagues from São Paulo's Butantan Institute report the first known evidence of oral venom glands in amphibians. Their research, supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, appears in the July 3, 2020, issue of iScience.

""We think of amphibians - frogs, toads and the like -- as basically harmless,"" says Brodie, emeritus professor in USU's Department of Biology. ""We know a number of amphibians store nasty, poisonous secretions in their skin to deter predators. But to learn at least one can inflict injury from its mouth is extraordinary.""

Brodie and his colleagues discovered the oral glands in a family of caecilians, serpent-like creatures related to frogs and salamanders. Neither snakes nor worms, caecilians are found in tropical climates of Africa, Asian and the Americas. Some are aquatic and some, like the ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) studied by Brodie's team, live in burrows of their own making.

In 2018, the team reported the species secreted substances from skin glands at both ends of its snake-like body. Concentrated at the head and extending the length of the body, the creature emits a mucous-like lubricant that enables it to quickly dive underground to escape predators. At the tail, caecilians have glands armed with a toxin, which acts as a last line of chemical defense, blocking a hastily burrowed tunnel from hungry hunters.

""What we didn't know is these caecilians have tiny fluid-filled glands in the upper and lower jaw, with long ducts that open at the base of each of their spoon-shaped teeth,"" Brodie says.

His research colleague Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, who studied with Brodie as a visiting graduate student at USU's Logan campus in 2015, noticed the never-before-described oral glands. Using embryonic analysis, Mailho-Fontana, first author of the paper, discovered the glands - called ""dental glands"" - originated from a different tissue than the slime and poison glands found in the caecilian's skin.

""The poisonous skin glands form from the epidermis, but these oral glands develop from the dental tissue, and this is the same developmental origin we find in the venom glands of reptiles,"" he says.

The researchers surmise caecilians, equipped with no limbs and only a mouth for hunting, activate their oral glands when they bite down on prey, including worms, termites, frogs and lizards.

The team doesn't yet know the biochemical composition of the fluid held in the oral glands.

""If we can verify the secretions are toxic, these glands could indicate an early evolutionary design of oral venom organs,"" Brodie says. ""They may have evolved in caecilians earlier than in snakes.""
