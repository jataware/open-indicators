{"title": "Chaplain says Washington Nationals\u2019 World Series run is \u2018story of faith\u2019", "publish_date": "07-24-2020 19:33", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 A baseball season and team are not often synonymous with religious or spiritual themes, but for Msgr. Stephen Rossetti, using words such as \u201cmiracle,\u201d \u201cgrace\u201d and \u201cfaith\u201d are actually the best ways to describe the 2019 World Series champion Washington Nationals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story of hope. It\u2019s a story of faith. It\u2019s a story of mutual love and friendship,\u201d said the priest, who has served as the Nationals\u2019 team priest chaplain for the past 10 years. \u201cIt\u2019s an inspiring story, a spiritual story, and it felt like a miracle.\u201d\n\nIn a talk at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, Rossetti shared with several attendees the Gospel lessons, inspiration and blessings that continue to resonate from a Nationals\u2019 season that began so bleakly, but against all odds rose to baseball\u2019s highest peak Oct. 30, 2019.\n\n\u201cIt was deeply moving for me and everybody. You could feel the electricity, something special was happening, a special spiritual grace happening,\u201d said Rossetti, referring to the October playoff start. \u201cThe players, coaches and staff all felt the same.\u201d\n\nDuring the regular season, Rossetti, who also is a licensed psychologist and teaches theology at The Catholic University of America, celebrates Mass at Nationals Park for the players, coaches, staff, stadium crew and the visiting team before every Sunday home game. The priest said he offers prayers for a safe, healthy game, but he doesn\u2019t pray specifically for a Nats\u2019 win.\n\n\u201cI think God knows who I\u2019m rooting for,\u201d he joked.\n\nAfter a nearly four-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic shutdown, the Nationals opened Major League Baseball\u2019s regular season with a July 23 evening game against the New York Yankees at Nationals Park.\n\nDue to COVID-19 safety precautions, no fans were going to be allowed in the stands, but the game was being televised on ESPN.\n\nThroughout the past decade, Rossetti said he has gotten to know many of the Nationals\u2019 front office staff and players. Although a majority of the players are young men between ages 19 and 28, he said they are respectful, mature and often faith-filled individuals.\n\n\u201cFrom top to bottom (of the Nats\u2019 organization), they are really nice people,\u201d he said in his July 2 talk at the museum.\n\nRossetti showed photographs of some of his favorite moments of the 2019 season, pointing out ways that remind him of the Gospel message. He said the team\u2019s motto for the playoffs \u2014 \u201cStay in the Fight\u201d \u2014 is a good example of the Christian virtue of hope.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up. \u2026 Hope is important for all our lives,\u201d he said, adding that he told the players: \u201cIf you gave up, you wouldn\u2019t be here (in the playoffs.) \u2026 It was inspiring that they never gave up.\u201d\n\nAfter the National League championship series win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Nationals Park, team manager Davey Martinez reflected on the rough start to the season, telling the overjoyed crowd, \u201cBumpy roads lead to beautiful places. And this is a beautiful place!\u201d\n\nRossetti said this is the same notion as the Paschal Mystery. \u201cWe must go through the darkness to get to the Resurrection,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all pay our dues. There are no easy lives. The Lord is with us, and walks with us.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Nationals for their great team effort all season long and during the playoffs and World Series, an example of the Christian ideal that every individual is important and counts.\n\n\u201cEach guy had their own moment. Davey believed in them and each guy rose to the moment and contributed,\u201d he said.\n\nRossetti also shared more personal insights on the championship season, including how moved he was to witness the transformation of Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg, whom he described as shy, but had come out of his shell thanks in part to teammates Gerardo Parra and Anibal Sanchez.\n\n\u201cIt really was the most touching moment of the playoff series,\u201d he said, showing a photo of the three players in a jubilant group hug.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been a personal journey for him. He\u2019s grown up, gotten married, had children,\u201d the priest said. \u201cLife becomes for you your own Gospel story.\u201d\n\nRossetti really became a baseball fan when the Nationals first arrived in the nation\u2019s capital in 2005.\n\nFifteen years later and with a World Series championship on the books, Rossetti said he feels very blessed to support the team and help keep the Lord present in their lives \u2014 win or lose.\n\nBut the season that ended with the championship, in particular, he said was a grace-filled experience that can serve to remind everyone of God\u2019s love and care for all.\n\n\u201cIt was a joy to be part of the Nationals\u2019 season in a modest way. I thank the Lord for that grace, and I hope whatever happens (this season), they will do well and \u2018Stay in the Fight,\u2019\u201d Rossetti said.\n\nBoyle writes for the Catholic Standard, newspaper of the Archdiocese of Washington.", "url": "https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2020/07/chaplain-says-washington-nationals-world-series-run-is-story-of-faith/", "school_rgx": 1, "adminX": "Washington", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Washington\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

A menacing thunderstorm circled the area and finally touched down on South Capitol Street shortly before 9 p.m. ET, and the game was not resumed after a delay was called with one out in the top of the sixth inning. Both teams hung around nearly two hours before the game was officially called.\n\nIt was so very 2020. But it was probably just as well.\n\nScherzer was more or less done, mixing stretches of brilliance \u2013 he struck out 11 Yankees \u2013 with the occasional hiccup against a Yankee offense that signaled it may be as punishing on the field as it is on paper.\n\nEspecially when both Aaron Judge and Stanton are healthy.\n\nThe corner outfielders both battled maladies this spring and summer but appear good to go. Judge singled off Scherzer in the first and then Stanton unloaded on a 94-mph Scherzer cutter, the crack of the bat and the clang of its arrival echoing throughout the nearly deserted ballpark.\n\n\"We\u2019re facing the world champs, we\u2019re facing Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole\u2019s on the mound for us, our guys came out with an edge and you could sense that in the dugout,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nStanton also drove in their final run with a fifth-inning single, not that Cole needed the extra cushion.\n\nHe was untouchable after yielding a first-inning home run to Adam Eaton, giving up no more hits to an emaciated Nationals lineup that lost Anthony Rendon to free agency and 21-year-old budding star Juan Soto to a positive test for the coronavirus.\n\nThat jolting news Thursday afternoon cast an immediate pall over the opener, a grim reminder of the risks the players will assume to get this season in, although Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo reported that Soto is asymptomatic.\n\nWithout their 21-year-old who drove in 110 runs and hit five postseason home runs, the Nationals inserted Andrew Stevenson in left field and the eighth spot in the lineup. He was badly overmatched by Cole, who struck out the career .241 hitter on five pitches in the second and four pitches in the fifth.\n\nCole may find tougher lineups throughout the all-East 60-game schedule the Yankees must navigate, but his precision Thursday was nonetheless compelling. He fired 10 pitches at least 96 mph, dotting the outside corner with ease.\n\nHe pitched from the same mound in his last start that mattered, Game 5 of the World Series against these Nationals. Cole dominated them that night, too, striking out nine over seven innings of a 7-1 win.\n\nBut he was a Houston Astro then, and the Nationals came back to win the final two games of that Series in Houston. Cole didn\u2019t get into Game 7 in relief and six weeks later was a Yankee, his $324 million contract the richest ever for a pitcher.\n\nThe wait for his debut in pinstripes was much longer: A four-month delay due to the coronavirus.\n\nIt ended after he threw just 75 pitches, weather, not the pandemic, to blame.\n\n\"I said to (wife) Amy, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to get a complete-game one-hitter in my debut,\" he noted.\n\nCole\u2019s contract runs for nine years, with hopes for games of much greater consequence than Thursday\u2019s.\n\nSome of them with fans in attendance, even.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/07/23/yankees-nationals-opening-day-giancarlo-stanton-gerrit-cole/5499335002/", "school_rgx": 2, "adminX": "Washington", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Washington\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "YMCA CEO Kevin Washington on Balancing Pandemic Response and Financial Pressures", "publish_date": null, "text": "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview above was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, July 19; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.\n\nThe YMCA, under CEO Kevin Washington, has played an important role in propping up the nation\u2019s fraying safety net during a pandemic that has also taken a severe financial toll on the Y. More than 1,000 Y\u2019s have been involved in some form of emergency food distribution, often working with local partners. Many Y\u2019s have seen their food-distribution efforts increase tenfold. The Y has played a critical role in caring for the children of essential workers, looking after up to 40,000 kids in June alone. The Y\u2019s also converted spaces into homeless shelters, partnered with the Red Cross on blood drives and helped check in on seniors and members of vulnerable communities to help ward off loneliness. Now the organization is reopening day camps during the crucial summer months.\n\nMeanwhile, a pause in gym memberships helped account for the Y\u2019s $800 million revenue shortfall for April and May. A handful of Y\u2019s have shut down, and more closures are likely. To keep afloat, more than 500 Y\u2019s across the U.S. received paycheck-protection loans from the federal government.\n\nWashington, 66, is the first African-American CEO of the YMCA of the USA; he started working at the Y 42 years ago as a youth-program director, after first becoming involved in Y programs when he was 10. He credits the Y with providing him a safe alternative to gang life on the streets of South Philadelphia. Washington joined TIME for a video conversation to talk about pivoting during the crisis, diversity in Y leadership, and what young people expect of today\u2019s leaders.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nThis interview with YMCA of the USA CEO Kevin Washington has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nA U.S. Census Bureau report recently found that about 25 million Americans aren\u2019t getting enough food to eat during the week. How has the Y helped address that situation?\n\nWe knew with schools closed that communities would be destitute in looking for food, particularly because of the significant unemployment issues [and] furloughs that were being dealt with. The Y stepped up and partnered with food banks and other entities to ensure that there was a continuous supply of food for those kids and families that needed it.\n\nWhat does it say about this country that so many people are living so close to the edge, that they are in need of emergency food?\n\nIt continues to show the significant inequities that exist in this country. And the thing that the pandemic has done is highlighted them. The question for us is, what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about it as a country? The significant number of inequities\u2014they\u2019re staring us in the face. And this is not about politics. It\u2019s about basic dignity and basic necessities that we want all people to have.\n\nHow is the Y helping chart the path forward?\n\nFirst, in order for us as an organization, we have got to work on ourselves. You cannot address inequities in this country if you haven\u2019t done the work on yourself first and foremost. You\u2019ve got to understand that what we have before us didn\u2019t just happen. It\u2019s been with us for over 400 years.\n\nYou\u2019re the first African-American CEO. How old is the Y?\n\nIt\u2019s 176 years old.\n\nThe word overdue is coming up a lot lately in conversations.\n\nWhat I will tell you is that as a person who grew up in the \u201960s, and seeing some of the things that have happened in the civil rights movement and beyond, I will tell you that I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m frustrated. I\u2019m angry. But I\u2019m hopeful.\n\nWhy?\n\nI\u2019m hopeful because of what I see in the streets today is what I would call a rainbow coalition of people. Particularly young people. My heart is with young people. I see young people who really are different, have different perspectives, have different understandings about what diversity, inclusion and equity mean. So I\u2019m very hopeful.\n\nSo it feels different than the \u201960s?\n\nIt feels different. But what I want to see is how do we address practices and policies and laws? Great, monuments are coming down. It\u2019s good for public relations. Practices, policies, laws is what I want to see.\n\nYou are putting your faith in young people?\n\nI say this all the time, that nothing\u2019s changed in any country, any revolution, on any issue, unless it was led by young people. People forget Martin Luther King Jr. was 26 when he started. When George Williams founded the YMCA, he was 22.\n\nYou mentioned looking at your own organization. How has the Y done? Are you satisfied with diversity at the Y?\n\nI don\u2019t know if you ever could be satisfied. You always want to be better. We have a good team of people from a diversity inclusion perspective. We can be better. We need to be better, our leaders, who lead that movement across the country. We\u2019re not where we need to be. Absolutely not.\n\nA lot of organizations with storied histories are looking back at their own records and finding things that they\u2019re not proud of and taking steps to change. What about the Y?\n\nWe are an American institution. It\u2019s been around since 1851 in the States. [The organization was founded in 1844 in London.] We represent the history of America. So all those things that were prevalent within the American society are reflected in the YMCA. If you look at the history of America, from 1851 on, you look at the history of the Y because we were part of that. We had segregated Y\u2019s. We can\u2019t deny it. It\u2019s real.\n\nTIME for Learning partnered with Columbia Business School to offer a series of online, on-demand classes on topics like effective leadership, negotiation and customer-centric marketing. To sign up or learn more, click here.\n\nLet\u2019s shift to another service that you provided during the pandemic, taking care of the children of essential workers. How did that come about when Y\u2019s were forced to close?\n\nWe pivoted. First and foremost, the Y is by any stretch of imagination the largest provider of child-development services in the country. Period. It was very essential. There\u2019s no way the economy can open or those kinds of services couldn\u2019t be provided because people had kids and families that needed to be taken care of. Doctors, first responders, people in grocery stores, drugstores. They needed somewhere to put their kids with schools being closed.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Y is by any stretch of imagination the largest provider of child-development services in the country. Period. - Kevin Washington, CEO of the YMCA of the USA\n\nThe Y is also a huge part of many seniors\u2019 lives, and the pandemic has taken a toll on older people. What have you done in that area?\n\nWe\u2019ve got 22 million YMCA members across this country. A million of them are seniors. And many of them are living alone. The Y is this socialization place where they come together to meet, engage with people. And so when that\u2019s taken away from them, there\u2019s a sense of isolation that can develop. Many YMCAs took it upon themselves to make sure they reached out to those individuals, to make sure they were getting what they needed. Make sure they were connecting with them. Doing Zoom classes with them. Having Zoom conversations with them. To ensure that there was an opportunity for them to connect with other human beings. To help prevent social isolation and depression.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s summertime, camp season. What is happening with your day camps and sleepaway camps?\n\nThe first is most of our what we call resident camps, sleepaway camps, have decided not to open. Our day camps? Many of them are operating. Because they are really essential services extended for kids and families.\n\nYou\u2019ve been busy.\n\nI should add that we were around in 1918 and went through a pandemic before too.\n\nThis is not your first pandemic.\n\nI don\u2019t want to do this ever, ever, ever again.\n\nHow much of what you\u2019re doing do you feel like is an essential service that the government should be providing?\n\nThat\u2019s why we asked them for money. [Laughs.] Here\u2019s the reality. What the government has the capacity to do is to give resources to the nonprofit sector like the Y and others, to do this work on their behalf. And do it at a much deeper level, less expensive, and in a much more authentic way because they have the relationships in those communities.\n\nDid Y\u2019s access the PPP?\n\nMany YMCAs were able to access PPP money. And I will tell you for many of them, that was a lifeblood to support them through this process.\n\nThis has taken a tremendous financial toll on the Y, right?\n\nOne of the reasons why we went after the federal government to get resources\u2014just in the month of April, the losses of revenue for the movement approached $400 million. One month.\n\nHow concerned are you about the financial health of the Y system?\n\nI\u2019m very concerned, because like most nonprofits, most of our YMCAs don\u2019t have significant reserves. We\u2019re sure that there will be some YMCAs that will not be able to survive.\n\nWhen did you first encounter the Y?\n\nI was born and raised in South Philadelphia. They had youth directors that would go to schools and form these clubs of boys. Unfortunately, it was only boys then. I was 10 years old at the time. The Christian Street YMCA: still there today. My mom would always ask where I was. I was at the Y. I learned to volunteer there. My brother, we had a church [basketball] league on Friday nights that involved most of the churches in the community. I wasn\u2019t old enough or good enough at that time to play. I kept score. And I cleaned the gym.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nWhat kind of neighborhood was it? What were the alternatives?\n\nThere weren\u2019t too many. When I grew up, either you were going to get involved in sports or a street gang. And I was fortunate enough to get engaged in sports and sidestep some of the other issues that a lot of my friends fell into. That was because of the Y.\n\nAre you still in touch with your friends that took another path?\n\nSeveral of them are no longer with us. I lost my first friend, his name was Chuckie, he was 13. He got stabbed. He was 13. He died. Some of my best friends \u2026 no longer with us. Losing those relationships at an early age, it\u2019s very tough. The Y helped me. The Y kept me from that. It gave me a place, a safe haven.\n\nWhat was your home life like growing up?\n\nWe weren\u2019t the richest family in the world. But we were rich in terms of our relationships. I\u2019m number four of six. My mother and father were there, and took care of us. Whatever pennies they could put together, we always, always had a good time. Didn\u2019t have much. But we had a great family in terms of our ability and our love for each other. We still have that today.\n\nWhat character traits did your parents infuse in you that you bring to work with you every day?\n\nWatching my father who worked as a packer in an assembly line. Didn\u2019t make a lot of money. But I could count the days on my hands that he missed work. We watched him when he was sick, when he was tired. Always got up on Monday morning and went to work. My mother, had she been in a different era, she would have gone to college and graduated. Smart, read books. Took care of the house. Made sure we got what we needed, meals and everything. Hard worker, took care of us. And put some discipline in us. She made us do our chores.\n\nWe\u2019re sure that there will be some YMCAs that will not be able to survive. - Kevin Washington, CEO of the YMCA of the USA\n\nWhat did your father pack at work?\n\nLamps. He worked there for probably 35 years.\n\nYou went to Temple University on a basketball scholarship. What position did you play? Did you have a go-to move?\n\nI was a guard. I had a mean crossover.

Soto rejoined the team July 16 and played in exhibition games against Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\nRizzo says Soto is asymptomatic after taking the test Tuesday and receiving the results Thursday morning, and says no other Nationals will be unavailable for the opener due to contact tracing ramifications. Nationals manager Dave Martinez said Soto tested negative four times before Thursday's positive result.\n\nAs part of its plan to return to play following a nearly four-month shutdown due to COVID-19, players are tested every other day, with results expected to be delivered within 24 to 48 hours. Soto is at least the 70th MLB player to publicly acknowledge testing positive; the vast majority of those positives occurred during intake testing around July 1 or earlier this summer.\n\nEven if Soto is healthy, the positive test result will sideline him for a significant portion of MLB's 60-game season. There is no specified isolation period in MLB's health and safety protocols, but a player must test negative in consecutive tests at least 24 hours apart, pass a health screening and be approved by doctors from MLB and the players' association.\n\nYankees closer Aroldis Chapman tested negative for COVID-19 at the start of summer camp, but produced a positive test taken around July 9. While Yankees GM Brian Cashman said Wednesday that Chapman is asymptomatic and working out at home, he continues testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nSoto played in an exhibition against the Orioles as recently as Tuesday night; MLB's health and safety protocols released before players returned to team facilities notes that only players who have come into \"close contact,\" as defined by the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) must pass an expedited diagnostic test and be tested every day for seven consecutive days.\n\nThe CDC's definition of \"close contact\" is someone \"living in the same household, being within six feet of someone for fifteen minutes or longer, or being in direct contact with secretions from a sick person with COVID-19 (e.g., being coughed on). Close contact does not include brief interactions, such as walking past someone.\"\n\nSoto hit 34 home runs and drove in 110 runs for the Nationals in 2019, and then added five more home runs in the postseason, including three in their seven-game World Series triumph over the Houston Astros.\n\n\"It crushed me when I found out,\" Martinez said on a video call Thursday.\n\nAnthony Fauci, the celebrated immunologist and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, is scheduled to throw out the first pitch before Thursday's game.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2020/07/23/juan-soto-covid-19-washington-nationals-coronavirus/5495707002/", "school_rgx": 4, "adminX": "Washington", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Washington\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "Nationals, Yankees take a knee before the anthem in Opening Day ceremony", "publish_date": "07-23-2020 00:00", "text": "A few seconds later, each member of the Nationals and Yankees stood for the national anthem. No player took a knee, ending speculation that players might choose to do so as the country\u2019s racial reckoning continues. Instead, they demonstrated in other ways. Some wore \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d T-shirts during pregame warmups, and many had the slogan affixed to a small patch on their game uniforms.\n\nThe demonstration to kneel with the black cloth, according to a report Thursday by the Athletic, is part of a leaguewide players initiative to hold a \u201cmoment of unity\u201d before each Opening Day game and is being led by Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Andrew McCutchen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlayers on the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants took part in the same ceremony before their opener later Thursday night, with each holding on to the black cloth while kneeling. But some members of both teams remained on their knees as the national anthem was played. Mookie Betts was the lone Dodgers player to kneel, and a couple of teammates put their hands on his shoulders in support. San Francisco Giants Manager Gabe Kapler and several of his players also took a knee during the anthem.\n\nThe players were distanced in front of the dugouts during the ceremony, a precautionary measure as the league began its 60-game schedule amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere were reminders of the pandemic everywhere Thursday night \u2014 missing was Nationals outfielder Juan Soto, who tested positive for the virus, while Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious-disease expert, threw out the ceremonial first pitch \u2014 but the baseball\u2019s efforts to stand against racial injustice were also at the forefront.\n\nFauci threw out the first pitch on a mound that had \u201cBLM\u201d stenciled into the dirt. Players were also given the option this week to wear patches on their jerseys that read \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or \u201cUnited For Change,\u201d and MLB lifted cleat restrictions so they could put social justice messages on their spikes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProtests against racial injustice and police brutality have permeated sports in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death in May. Since then, players across professional sports have taken a knee during the anthem to protest, just as former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had before NFL games in 2016.\n\nThis week, Kapler and several of his players took a knee during the anthem before an exhibition game, which drew quick criticism from President Trump in a tweet. A Los Angeles Angels pitcher also knelt and raised his fist during the national anthem before an exhibition game Monday, and four Cincinnati Reds players also took a knee during the anthem before another game Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nThat led some to wonder whether there would be demonstrations during the national anthem Thursday night. A day earlier, Major League Baseball \u2014 which in 2019 had just 68 African American players among the 882 players on Opening Day rosters, injured lists and restricted lists, according to USA Today \u2014 rolled out options for players to recognize the movement against racial injustice during the shortened season.\n\nAD\n\nAs teams opened summer camp in early July, some reportedly held meetings throughout the month to address social issues. The Nationals held a meeting Tuesday, with closer Sean Doolittle telling his teammates that he would kneel with them if they chose to do so.\n\nBut that moment never came before Thursday night\u2019s game in Washington, and many players placed their hands over their hearts as D.C. Washington sang a precorded version of the national anthem. Doolittle later caught the first pitch by Fauci, and the season was soon underway.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI noticed, it\u2019s not just one or two guys, it\u2019s both entire teams,\u201d ESPN broadcaster Alex Rodriguez said of the ceremony during the game\u2019s telecast. \u201cIt\u2019s because baseball is a tight community and so many have suffered for so long and are still suffering.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/23/nationals-yankees-take-knee-before-anthem-opening-day-ceremony/", "school_rgx": 1, "adminX": "Washington", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Washington\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

Because Dr. Fauci is a career civil servant, his job is not in jeopardy, and it is unlikely that Mr. Trump can completely exile him, given his emergence as the government\u2019s most credible voice on the pandemic.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.\n\nThe newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro\u2019s column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday\u2019s newspaper.\n\nNavarro wrote that Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, \u201chas been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check storyby Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro\u2019s claims.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how Navarro\u2019s column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he\u2019s letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last monththat an opinion column by U.S. Sen.

The total number is 48.\n\nTwo people are hospitalized. More than 37,500 people have been tested.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority on Friday reported there were 396 new cases statewide, bringing the total to 16,104. There were nine new deaths, bringing the total to 282.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on state\u2019s early child care guidance?\n\nGov. Kate Brown is seeking Oregonians\u2019 opinions on newly proposed changes to COVID-19 guidance for child care and early learning programs.\n\nBrown announced the new draft guidance in a news release Thursday. The newest version builds on the guidance last updated in May and expands requirements on children\u2019s mask use, family engagement and group sizes.\n\nThe guidance was reviewed by the Healthy Early Learners Council this week, and the governor\u2019s office is taking public input on the changes online until Sunday, in both English and Spanish.\n\nRead story here.\n\n24 million Americans fear missing next rent payment\n\nDays from the end of enhanced unemployment benefits and a federal eviction moratorium, 24 million Americans say they have little to no chance of being able to pay next month\u2019s rent, a U.S. Census Bureau survey shows.\n\nA disproportionate share of those in danger come from Black and Hispanic households, two groups who have borne the brunt of negative health and economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Congress works to negotiate a new stimulus, experts warn the time to ward off an eviction and foreclosure crisis has almost run out.\n\n\"We're about to fall off a massive cliff and see a major spike in evictions,\" said Alanna McCargo, vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute.\n\n\u2013 Kevin Crowe, Theresa Diffendal and Carlie Procell, USA Today\n\nIn Lane County, more than 1,500 apply for $5.1 million in rent assistance\n\nAfter a week of accepting applications for federal rental assistance, Lane County now need to go through the 1,555 completed applications. A total of $5.1 million is available via the federal COVID-19 CARES Act and will be distributed in a lottery-type fashion for rent expenses since March 1.\n\nThe amount of people in need of help is startling, but not surprising, said Devon Ashbridge, a spokesperson for Lane County.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to do everything we can to stretch funding and help as many people as possible but it really depends on what each applicant needs,\" Ashbridge said.\n\nRead the story here.\n\n\u2013 Tatiana Parafiniuk-Talesnick\n\nOpen letter from health professionals\n\nIt's time to hit the reset button: Shut it down and restart. That's what more than 150 health professionals are urging government leaders in an open letter published earlier this week.\n\n\"Tell the American people the truth about the virus, even when it\u2019s hard. Take bold action to save lives \u2014 even when it means shutting down again,\" the letter, spearheaded by the nonprofit U.S. Public Interest Research Group, says.\n\nPublic health leaders argue in the letter that the U.S. reopened too quickly, nonessential businesses should close again, Americans should mostly stay home, and government officials need to invest more in testing, contact tracing, and personal protective equipment capacities.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t take these actions, the consequences will be measured in widespread suffering and death,\" according to the letter addressed to President Donald Trump, federal officials and governors.\n\nFauci says he has security after threats to him, family\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said he has received security amid heightened threats to him and his family. Fauci made the comments on CNN's \"The Axe Files\" podcast and said that many of the threats come from people who are angry and believe, \"I'm interfering with their life because I'm pushing a public health agenda.\"\n\nThe longtime head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said he has been a target since the early days of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as the first government official speaking out about the virus. He said he received hate mail then but could largely ignore it. The backlash he's received during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is of a different magnitude, he said.\n\n\"The kind of not only hate mail but actual, serious threats against me are not good,\" Fauci said. \"It's tough. Serious threats against me, against my family, my daughters, my wife. I mean, really? Is this the United States of America? But it's real. It really is real.\"\n\nFauci added: \"We are all trying to open up American again in a way that is safe, that we can do it in a measured fashion. But the hostility against public health issues is difficult to not only understand but difficult to even process.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with the business news outlet MarketWatch, Fauci also said he would not eat inside a restaurant or get on a flight given the current state of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\n\nPoll: 3 in 4 Americans want mask wearing required\n\nAn overwhelming 3 out of 4 Americans support requiring people to wear masks in public, a new poll found.\n\nAlmost 90% of Democrats as well as nearly 60% of Republicans support requiring masks outside of people's homes. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll was conducted before President Donald Trump, who had been dismissive of wearing masks despite public health officials' support, tweeted earlier this week that wearing a face covering is patriotic.\n\nAlthough partisan rhetoric around masks has undermined what public health officials say is a simple step that can save lives, 95% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans say they\u2019re wearing face coverings when leaving the house.\n\nThe poll also found about two-thirds of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the pandemic.\n\nCoronavirus is tearing through Latino communities \u2013 and it may get worse\n\nThe coronavirus\u2019 continued rampage through the southern and western United States is almost certain to leave an especially deadly trail among Latinos, who not only represent a significant percentage of the population in those regions but often face structural conditions that make them more vulnerable.\n\nA new study published Thursday, the first nationwide analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths among Latinos, concludes that crowded housing arrangements and high-risk jobs in industries like meatpacking, poultry and hospitality are among the major reasons Latinos have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n\nAs the virus extracts a heavy toll on California, Texas and Florida \u2014 the three states with the largest Latino populations \u2014 the death count among the country\u2019s biggest minority group could be staggering.\n\n\"My prediction is that it\u2019s very likely because the policies and practices that are needed to prevent infections and deaths are not in place,\u2019\u2019 said Carlos Rodriguez-Diaz, the study's lead author.\n\n\u2013 Jorge L. Ortiz\n\nCDC guidelines for schools: Wear masks, wash hands, don't touch\n\nParent check-list for back-to-school: Label your child's face mask with permanent marker. Have them practice putting on and taking off their mask without touching the cloth. Make a labeled, resealable plastic bag to store their mask during lunch time. Those are among the suggestions the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for school administrators and parents as families prepare for school to resume in the fall.\n\nStudents should wear masks, wash their hands frequently and socially distance to protect against COVID-19 as schools reopen this fall, CDC urged in new guidance documents for administrators published Thursday. \"It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,\" said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield in a release.\n\nCDC, the nation's top public health agency, has faced considerable political pressure from President Donald Trump and others to get schools reopened.\n\nA key consideration for school administrators, CDC said, was COVID-19 transmission rates in their communities. But the CDC guidance offered no specific metrics for what transmission rates would require specific actions.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Weise\n\nGOP backs more stimulus checks, funds for schools in new aid package\n\nSenate Republicans were scrambling Thursday to finalize a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package that will include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and additional funding to help schools recover from the pandemic.\n\nGOP leaders and the White House said late Wednesday that they had agreed on key parts of the legislation, which will serve as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who have already passed their own bill in the House.\n\nBut Republicans are still struggling to put the finishing touches on the package. Congress and the White House are under pressure to clinch a deal on a fresh pandemic aid package; a federal program of expanded unemployment benefits is set to run out within days.\n\nOne item that will be missing from the GOP plan is Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut. Republicans abandoned that proposal even though Trump had suggested he might not sign any bill that doesn\u2019t include it.\n\nArizona governor announces guidelines for schools reopening\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered public health officials to choose data by Aug. 7 for schools to rely on when deciding when to reopen schools for in-person classes. When schools reopen, everyone will be required to wear masks, with some exceptions for students, Ducey added.\n\nThe plan comes with another major requirement for schools. Under the order, schools will be required to reopen for on-site learning on Aug. 17 for students who have nowhere else to go. That means, Superintendent Kathy Hoffman said, districts have to open at least one site for students to go, but do not have to open every school or require every teacher to show up to work in-person. Schools also are required to provide distance learning as an option.\n\n\u2013 Lily Altavena, Arizona Republic\n\nNew CDC guidelines: People with mild to moderate COVID-19 only need to isolate 10 days\n\nPeople who have had mild to moderate COVID-19 can come out of isolation after 10 days and don't need to be retested before going back to work, new CDC guidelines say. Symptoms, not testing, are the guide. If patients had a fever, it needs to have been gone for at least 24 hours.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document, published Wednesday, says symptoms are a better gauge of how infectious someone is so they are \"not kept unnecessarily isolated and excluded from work or other responsibilities.\"\n\nThe document acknowledges that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is so new that doctors are still gathering evidence for how it works. As more data becomes available, the medical community is gaining a better understanding of how people who are infected can avoiding passing on the disease. The new guidelines reflect the latest thinking.\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Weise\n\nAmtrak tightens face mask requirement\n\nAmtrak on Thursday joined U.S. air carriers in tightening face mask requirements, saying passengers could be removed or banned from its trains for non-compliance. The railroad service had begun requiring face masks in May, but had allowed passengers to remove them when seated alone. Now, passengers can only remove their masks when they're in private rooms, an option only available on the company's long-distance trains.\n\n\"Amtrak reserves the right to remove customers or ban them from future travel in the event of noncompliance with Amtrak's face covering policy,\" Amtrak said on its website.\n\n\u2013 Curtis Tate\n\nTrump cancels Jacksonville portion of RNC due to COVID-19\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Thursday he is canceling the Jacksonville portion of the Republican National Convention because of the coronavirus pandemic, a major setback in his effort to energize his struggling bid for reelection. \"The timing for this event is not right,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"There's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe.\"\n\nTrump said that he would deliver remarks to formally accept his party's nomination for president but offered no detail on where or when that will happen. The abrupt decision was not only a significant blow to his campaign but also raised questions about the president's narrative that the country is ready to reopen for business.\n\nTrump said convention delegates will still gather in North Carolina, where the official business of the convention was set to take place, and formally nominate him for reelection.\n\nLate Thursday, Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez reaffirmed that his party will hold its national convention next month in Milwaukee, with a mostly virtual event. Delegates will vote remotely. Joe Biden has said he intends to accept the nomination in Milwaukee\n\n\u2013 John Fritze, Courtney Subramanian, Michael Collins and Bill Glauber\n\nAMC Theatres delays reopening again\n\nAMC Theatres is delaying its planned reopening date again amid a spike in COVID-19 cases in dozens of states. The movie theater chain said Thursday that it is now planning to reopen its U.S. locations in \"mid to late August.\"\n\nThe company had previously set its reopening date for July 15 and then delayed it to July 30. But sharp increases in COVID-19 cases in states such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, coupled with Hollywood delaying film releases, have combined to make a swift return to indoor moving showings implausible.\n\n\u2013 Nathan Bomey\n\nFlorida, Texas among states with deadliest weeks\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Wednesday shows 12 states set records for new cases over a seven-day period while six states had a record number of deaths over the period. New case records were set in Alaska, California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Record numbers of deaths were reported in Florida, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nIn Florida, the week's death toll was 824, more than twice the number of any week during the spring COVID-19 surge. Still, Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to press for in-classroom learning when schools open, some in less than three weeks. DeSantis stressed that young people face the least risk from the virus.\n\n\"It is our kids who have borne the harshest burden of the controlled measures instituted to protect against the virus,\" DeSantis said Wednesday.\n\n\u2013 Michael Stucka\n\nOregon virus cases could reach 1,600 a day in August\n\nSALEM \u2014 The Oregon Health Authority's latest coronavirus projections predict that, based on the current rate of cases, the state will have 1,600 new confirmed infections a day by mid-August.\n\nIn a more \"pessimistic\" model, officials said if transmission increases by 10 percentage points from the current rates, there could be 2,300 new daily confirmed infections and 46 hospitalizations a day.\n\nIn the month of July, Oregon has averaged about 315 cases a day. On Thursday officials reported 331 new cases and two deaths, raising the state's total case count to 15,713. The death toll is 273.\n\nRead the story here.\n\nGood to see cases starting to slow down, Lane County says\n\nThere total number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Lane County on Thursday rose by seven from the day before to 419, according to public health spokesman Jason Davis.\n\nThat increase is larger than most of the days in the first months of the pandemic in Lane County, but lower than most newer daily case counts. Over the weekend, Lane County saw a single day with 40 new cases, the highest one-day increase so far.\n\n\"It is good to see that our cases are starting to slow down. It\u2019s definitely too soon to call that a win, but it is encouraging,\" Davis said at Thursday\u2019s public health briefing.\n\nTwo Lane County residents currently are hospitalized with COVID-19. Davis said people from other counties with COVID-19 also are using local hospitals.\n\nDavis said 42 Lane County residents are known to be infectious at this time.\n\nMore than 35,500 locals have been tested so far. The positivity rate is less than 1%. Davis said the county is averaging about 600 novel coronavirus tests per day.\n\nBetween July 13-19:\n\n\u2013 Lane County confirmed 73 new cases\n\n\u2013 35.6% of those cases were community transmission, meaning there is no known exposure point or existing cases linked to their getting sick\n\n\u2013 about 14.7% of those cases were household transmission\n\n\u2013 there were around 315 people being monitored as having been possibly exposed to those 73 news cases\n\n\u2013 86% of cases were in adjacent zip codes to the Eugene-Springfield metro area.\n\n\u2013 nearly 50% of total cases since the pandemic started are under the age of 30\n\n\u2013 about 16% of total cases since the pandemic started are between the ages 41-60\n\n\u2013 about 6.3% of total cases since the pandemic started were over the age of 70\n\nStarting Friday, children age 5 and up are required to wear a face covering.\n\nFace coverings are now required when exercising indoors, plus outdoors when people can\u2019t keep appropriate physical distance. People with a disability or medical condition may request accommodation from the business if they cannot wear a mask.\n\nU.S. hits 4 million cases of COVID-19\n\nThe U.S. hit the latest bleak milestone Thursday in the historic and deadly pandemic: 4 million confirmed cases of infections.\n\nAnd experts agree the number of cases is actually much greater \u2014 potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported, according to federal data.\n\nMeanwhile, almost 150,000 people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus as the nation continues to lead the world for most cases and deaths.\n\n\"We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in a Facebook Live interview July 6. \"And I would say, this would not be considered a wave. It was a surge, or a resurgence of infections superimposed upon a baseline.\"\n\n\u2013 Khrysgiana Pineda\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe U.S. has surpassed 4 million confirmed cases and has more than 144,000 deaths, according to John Hopkins University data.

{"title": "Federal agents in unmarked cars, 'wall of moms': Here's what's happening in Portland", "publish_date": "07-20-2020 00:00", "text": "Weeks of protests and the presence of federal authorities in Portland have brought the Oregon city into the national spotlight as tensions rise amid call for racial justice and changes to policing.\n\nThe city has seen nightly protests for nearly two months following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd was a Black man who died as a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck, and his death sparked a national movement and protests to address systemic racism.\n\nIn Portland, a city where protests are not uncommon, demonstrators and police have clashed for weeks with protesters lighting fires and law enforcement firing tear gas and other munitions.\n\nHeightening tensions during the protest is the presence of federal law enforcement agents. Video shared on social media from last week showed what appear to be federal officers in unmarked cars arresting people without explanation, prompting outcry and lawsuits.\n\n'Wall of moms':Group of mothers at Portland protest formed to protect demonstrators\n\nWhy are people protesting in Portland?\n\nThe increased unrest in Portland began in the days after Floyd's death. Cities across the United States saw clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement similar to those in Portland.\n\nActivists have called for policies to challenge systemic racism, including to defund the police and reinvest the funds into other civil services like public housing and mental health support. Demonstrators have also decried the use of excess force by police, and law enforcement has responded to many protests by using force.\n\nIn Portland, video has shown both city police and federal law enforcement using tear gas or other munitions to disperse crowds.\n\nAccording to the Oregonian, the city's police union has also drawn sharp criticism from protesters who say it hinders any possible changes to the department. On Saturday night, protesters set a fire at the Portland Police Association's building, but it was put out quickly.\n\nOn Sunday, a group of women formed what could be called a human shield, dubbed the \"wall of moms,\" at the front of a protest outside a federal courthouse. Videos on social media showed the group chanting, \"Moms are here, feds stay clear\" and \"Leave our kids alone.\"\n\nProtesters say federal police arrested them in unmarked cars\n\nFederal agents were first seen in Portland on June 27, according to the Oregonian.\n\nThe newspaper reported that after protesters tore down a statue of George Washington in June, the city came under President Donald Trump's scrutiny. Trump mentioned the city at his Tulsa campaign rally, and the day after he signed an executive order on monuments, federal officers in camouflage were seen outside the federal courthouse, the Oregonian reported.\n\nThe presence of federal authorities in the city has ramped up ever since, and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf last Thursday during a visit to the city called the demonstrators \"violent anarchists.\"\n\n'Secret police force':Feds reportedly pull Portland protesters into unmarked vehicles, stirring outrage\n\nThe agents come from the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and an elite U.S. Customs and Border Protection team based on the U.S.-Mexico border and have been deployed to protect federal property.\n\nLast week, video also surfaced of the federal authorities using unmarked vehicles to detain people, seemingly without an explanation.\n\nConner O\u2019Shea, 30, a Portland resident who\u2019s been attending protests for almost two months, told USA TODAY that early Thursday morning he and a friend were walking back to their car after leaving a protest when they were pursued by men they believed to be federal agents.\n\nO\u2019Shea said after being warned by other protesters that federal agents were driving around in unmarked vans \"snatching people,\" a van pulled over to the side walk and \u201cfour of five dudes in camo jump out and start charging at us.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Shea did not see any sort of identifying markers on their camouflage uniforms. He said he got away, but his friend, Mark Pettibone, 29, was arrested and booked by federal agents.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that it detained a protester but disputed accounts that it did so without reason. The agency, which did not name Pettibone, said agents had information about a person suspected of assaulting federal agents or destroying federal property. The statement did not address the use of unmarked vans.\n\nFederal authorities' use of less-lethal rounds has also drawn criticism. Donavan LaBella, 26, was critically injured and hospitalized after he was hit in the head by a less-lethal round fired by a federal officer on July 11.\n\nBystander videos show LaBella collapsing to the ground unconscious and bleeding profusely from the head. He was standing with both arms in the air holding a large speaker across the street from the courthouse when he was hit.\n\nPortland mayor calls federal actions 'blatant abuse of police tactics'\n\nPortland's mayor and state officials have repeatedly blasted the presence of federal law enforcement in the city and taken legal action.\n\nOn Sunday, Mayor Ted Wheeler said federal officers \u201care not wanted here. We haven\u2019t asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a blatant abuse of police tactics by the federal government,\" Wheeler, a Democrat, said Sunday.\n\nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum filed a lawsuit Friday against several federal agencies alleging agents in unmarked vehicles grabbed people off Portland's streets without a warrant.\n\nThe lawsuit says the agents violated the civil rights of Oregon residents by using unlawful tactics. It also asks the court to require federal agents to identify themselves and their agency before conducting an arrest and give an explanation to any person being detained for the arrest.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney in Portland, Billy Williams, also said Friday he had asked the Department of Homeland Security inspector general to investigate the incidents.\n\nWheeler also drew a distinction between the city's officers and federal authorities following LaBella's injuries.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear so that there\u2019s no confusion,\u201d Wheeler said earlier this month. \u201cThe serious injuries sustained by Donavan LaBella at the hands of a federal officer were unacceptable.\u201d\n\nMore on Portland:Oregon AG sues federal agencies over Portland arrests, says tactics are similar to kidnapping\n\nHowever, Jo Ann Hardesty, one of the city's commissioners, was critical of Portland police's actions, saying its officers \u201cjoined in the aggressive clampdown of peaceful protest.\u201d Hardesty, who oversees Portland's fire department and other first-responder agencies, said in an open letter to Wheeler if \u201cyou can\u2019t control the police, give me the Portland Police Bureau.\u201d\n\nThe Oregonian reported that Portland police have worked in tandem with the federal agents in the city to disperse protesters, despite some city officials insisting otherwise.\n\nThe newspaper reported that local officers have been seen marching shoulder-to-shoulder with federal authorities to clear streets.\n\n\u201cWe do communicate with federal officers for the purpose of situational awareness and de-confliction,\u201d Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell said at a Friday press conference, per the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in a very, very close proximity to one another, sometimes within the area of a city block.\n\nThe city's police do not take orders from federal agents nor vice versa, Lovell added.\n\nTrump: We are trying to help Portland\n\nOn Sunday, Trump defended federal action in the city, saying, \"We are trying to help Portland, not hurt it.\"\n\nTrump also criticized the city's elected officials saying they had \"lost control\" and alleged that the protesters were \"anarchists and agitators\" and \"the real deal!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ken Cuccinelli, Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary, dismissed the uproar over the use of unmarked vehicles in Portland, saying the practice is \"so common it's barely worth discussion.\"\n\n\"Literally, every police department in America has them,\" Cuccinelli said on CNN's New Day on Monday.\n\nContributing: Khrysgiana Pineda, Joel Shannon, N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Kristine Phillips, Lindsay Schnell and The Associated Press", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/20/portland-protests-federal-agents-unmarked-cars-and-walls-moms/5470780002/", "school_rgx": 1, "adminX": "Oregon", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Oregon\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

Sure, leagues like the NBA and MLB are playing right now, but those players are professional athletes. They stand to lose millions of dollars if they don't take the field.\n\nWhereas the amateurism of then NCAA means the athletes aren't making a dime, even if they play.\n\nHowever, there are still millions of dollars on the line, and Schwartz knows it's the driving force behind a return to play.\n\n\"It's the money, right? It's the money. We know that 85% of all college football budgets are derived from football profits. That's why football is being pushed to play, otherwise, we have a catastrophic collapsing of athletic departments. So the question is, how much is that burden on the college athletes? - Geoff Schwartz on NCAA Football\n\nThe interesting part, however, is that teams are unlikely to return to stadiums with fans in the stands. If your 60,000 seat stadium has no one in it, then you are losing millions anyway. No ticket revenue. No concession revenue. No merchandise revenue.\n\nRegardless of money gained or lost, health should be priority number one.\n\n\"I think we have to look at the data that's being presented to us as far as how COVID affects the individuals in the age range,\" said Schwartz. \"I do think there's still... incomplete data on the side effects of COVID. It's new. It's a novel coronavirus. It's still new to figure out.\"\n\nWhile the players will be on the ones playing the game, they won't be the only ones at risk. College coaches, many of whom are in the more at-risk age groups, will be on the field too.\n\nThat fact alone worries Schwartz the most.\n\n\"I'm worried less about players dying versus players having long-term health issues because they contract COVID,\" said Schwartz. \"The coaches are more in the age range where COVID can be more deadly, where it can really affect them, and where they can get really sick. So how much do we protect the coaches, basically, from themselves during the situation.\"\n\nSo what will college football look like? We still don't know for sure. The Ducks are currently scheduled to start the season on September 26 against Colorado. There is still time to figure it all out, there's just not a lot of time to do it.\n\nHear more from Geoff Schwartz on the latest episode of the Talkin' Ducks podcast.", "url": "https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/oregon-ducks/former-oregon-duck-joe-young-drops-74-piece-chicken-nugget-cba-game", "school_rgx": 0, "adminX": "Oregon", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Oregon\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "Update: Oklahoma State's Season Opener Against Oregon State Canceled", "publish_date": null, "text": "STILLWATER -- It's official, a little more than 24 hours after the Big Ten announced a conference-only schedule for the 2020 season, the Pac 12 has followed.\n\nThe Pac 12 announced on Friday that football, along with several other sports, would be playing a conference-only schedule for the fall of 2020, effectively canceling Oklahoma State's opener against Oregon State in Stillwater on Sept. 3.\n\nIronically, the commissioner of the Pac 12, Larry Scott, revealed shortly after the news from the conference that he has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nOklahoma State is now going through the seismic shift the rest of college football embarked on earlier this week when the Ivy League became the first Division I (FCS) conference to make a move and cancel or postpone their football season until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe more influential move was made Thursday when the Big Ten announced that they would play conference games only, if they play any football games this fall.\n\nThe big picture question is now with two Power Five leagues going to conference games only, what will the Big 12 do? Hang on to this one for a few paragraphs.\n\nThe small picture question is what does that mean for Oklahoma State and the return game in the home and home series that started last season with the Cowboys visiting the Beavers in Corvallis?\n\nEfforts to reach Oklahoma State deputy athletic director Chad Weiberg were unsuccessful. Weiberg had insisted, as had reports from media in Corvallis, Ore. that cover the Beavers program, that Oregon State had every intention of being in Stillwater if the game was going to be played.\n\nMike Gundy shakes hands with Jonathan Smith after the win over Oregon State in Corvallis to open last season, USA Today Sports Images - Troy Wayrynen\n\nA high-ranking Oklahoma State athletic department official did tell Pokes Report that the contract with Oregon State has a clause for them to opt out of this season's game for unusual or extreme circumstances and make the game up in a later season. That is likely going to be the action taken now that the Pac 12 is no longer allowing members to play non conference games.\n\n\"It may be 15-years from now, but Oregon State will come and play in Stillwater,\" said our source.\n\nAs for the rest of the non conference season, the Tulsa game (Sept. 12) looks to be the most certain of the three. They are close by, have a long standing relationship with Oklahoma State and they are expected to monitor their team for coronavirus.\n\nThe other non conference game is with Western Illinois (Sept. 19). The problem presented there is how aggressively the FCS program will monitor and test their team for COVID-19. As of now, the Missouri Valley Football Conference and it's teams are planning on playing this season, although a number of Division II conferences have announced postponing football in the fall.\n\nThe Western Illinois game is one that Oklahoma State would have to examine closely with regards to concerns regarding the coronavirus.\n\nIf the Big 12 is playing non conference games, some options would be to look around at other regional schools that have lost a non conference game and match up. Or the Pokes could play Tulsa multiple times if their schedule allows it, or play another Big 12 team that loses a non conference game like TCU against Cal that first weekend and play it as a non conference game.\n\nTulsa is scheduled to host Toledo (Sept. 5), host Northwestern State (La) (Sept. 19), and travel to Arkansas State (Sept. 26). North Texas might be a good match for an opener as they are scheduled to host Houston Baptist on Sept. 5, but given conditions in Houston that game could be in question.\n\nAll of this leads to the big picture question and the Big 12 is not inclined to move right now on any action. Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby prefers to wait and see as most officials in college sports believed the deadline for firm decisions on the college football season is July 31.\n\nWhen Randy Peterson of the Des Moines Register asked Bowlsby if the Big 12 planned to make a decision on the season soon, such as announcing conference games only, his one word answer was, \"No!.\"\n\n\"We need to do what our doctors and our scientists are telling us, which is move slowly ahead and constantly reevaluate,\" Bowlsby told CBS Sports on Thursday. \"That is going to decide whether we're ready and able to play.\"\n\nThe Big 12 athletic directors are said to favor playing non conference games and not limiting to conference games only.\n\n\"The only advantage to [a conference-only schedule] is you can spread the games out over more weeks,\" Bowlsby analyzed. \"It doesn't mean you're going to start your schedule the first week of October. You're going to try to start it on time and spread it out so you have more time to recover and more time to get over outbreaks.

{"title": "Medi-Cal mystery: Millions of enrollees haven\u2019t materialized in California", "publish_date": "07-24-2020 00:00", "text": "By Rachel Bluth and Angela Hart | Kaiser Health News\n\nThe predictions were dire: Coronavirus lockdowns would put millions of Americans out of work, stripping them of their health insurance and pushing them into Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administration projected that the pandemic would force about 2 million additional people to sign up for the state\u2019s Medi-Cal program by July, raising enrollment to an all-time high of 14.5 million Californians \u2014 more than one-third of the state\u2019s population.\n\nBut July is almost over, and Medi-Cal enrollment has hovered around 12.5 million since March, when the pandemic shut down much of the economy \u2014 though enrollment ticked up in May and June, according to the latest data from the state Department of Health Care Services, which administers the program.\n\nEssentially, enrollment hasn\u2019t budged even though nearly 3 million Californians are newly unemployed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, an advocacy group for health consumers. \u201cWe have lots of plausible explanations, but they don\u2019t seem to add up.\u201d\n\nEven the state is stumped. The enrollment data is preliminary, and Medi-Cal officials expect the numbers to grow as eligibility appeals and other \u201cunusual cases\u201d are resolved, but not by 2 million people, said Norman Williams, spokesperson for the Department of Health Care Services.\n\nThe department based its projections on the state\u2019s experience with the Great Recession a decade ago, a comparison that it now acknowledges was misguided because the pandemic did not spur a purely economic crisis. The state failed to predict people would avoid care at clinics and hospitals during this public health crisis, and thus be less likely to need coverage immediately.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is far more complex because it involves both economic and health decisions, creating a more complicated picture more closely related to that seen during the 1918 influenza pandemic,\u201d Williams said in a prepared statement.\n\nEven with the faulty comparison, it\u2019s not clear why more Californians haven\u2019t enrolled, he said.\n\n\u201cThe state prepared an estimate based on the best data available, during an unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe miscalculation meant the state likely allocated more money to Medi-Cal than the program now needs, even as lawmakers struggled to find ways to prevent deep health care cuts and close a massive $54 billion budget deficit as they negotiated the 2020-21 state budget in May and June.\n\nAnd a more accurate estimate could have potentially funded new programs, such as expanding Medi-Cal to unauthorized immigrants age 65 and up, some state lawmakers and advocacy groups said.\n\nNewsom backed that expansion of Medi-Cal, estimated to cost $80.5 million in the first year, in his January budget proposal but abandoned it in May, citing California\u2019s financial crisis spurred by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about life-or-death services, so to say I\u2019m frustrated is putting it mildly,\u201d said state Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the Senate budget committee and leads budget negotiations in the upper house. \u201cIt\u2019s irritating to me that they can be so off.\u201d\n\nThe new state budget puts Medi-Cal\u2019s overall cost at $115 billion, of which $2.4 billion in state money has been earmarked for caseload growth. Yet it\u2019s unclear how much of that could have been available to fund other programs or stave off cuts had the caseload projection been more accurate, department officials acknowledged.\n\nMost states predicted their Medicaid enrollment would rise due to the pandemic, though many are seeing similar delays in Medicaid sign-ups, said Cindy Mann, a partner at the legal and consulting firm Manatt Health who served as federal Medicaid director for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the Obama administration.\n\nWashington state, like California, hasn\u2019t seen its Medicaid caseload grow as expected, said MaryAnne Lindeblad, its Medicaid director. It projected up to 95,000 people would join the program by now, yet it has seen 80,000 new enrollees since March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much going on in people\u2019s lives right now and signing up for Medicaid doesn\u2019t seem to be one of them.\u201d\n\nYet a record number of Americans have lost health insurance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding economic crash, according to a new report from Families USA, a national health advocacy group. California experienced the largest increase in newly uninsured residents of any state so far when an estimated 689,000 people lost coverage between February and May this year, the study shows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of downturn and that might explain some of the reason we\u2019re seeing lags across the country,\u201d Mann said. \u201cBut unless unemployment numbers turn around dramatically, which is not the prediction, I think we will see the number of uninsured people continuing to grow and turn to the program.\u201d\n\nThere are several theories about why Californians who have lost their jobs during the pandemic have not yet enrolled in Medi-Cal.\n\nFor one, signing up for food and housing assistance appears \u201cmore urgent\u201d than signing up for Medi-Cal, Williams said.\n\nThe pandemic has also created new sign-up hurdles. With libraries, schools, community centers and county health care offices largely closed during lockdowns, uninsured residents have had fewer places to enroll. Hospitals and clinics also frequently enroll uninsured people into the program, but many healthy people are avoiding treatment for fear of being infected with COVID-19.\n\nAnd those who have lost jobs may still have work-based coverage because employers planned to rehire them and kept them on job-based insurance plans, or because they\u2019ve signed up for COBRA insurance temporarily.\n\nEnrollment could also be lagging because the service industry has been hit hard, and many low-income workers in restaurants, bars or salons were already enrolled in Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter who were at risk of losing jobs were already enrolled when the crisis started,\u201d said Laurel Lucia, director of health care programs at the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nVanessa Poveda, 28, wasn\u2019t among the service workers already enrolled in Medi-Cal when the crisis hit. Instead, she had health insurance through her job as a server at Bartlett Hall, an upscale gastropub near San Francisco\u2019s Union Square.\n\nWhen Poveda was laid off during the first round of coronavirus closures in March, the restaurant extended her health coverage for 30 days before it expired, she said. Now unemployed and uninsured, she thinks she probably qualifies for Medi-Cal but hasn\u2019t signed up.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really gotten around to it,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause Poveda is relatively healthy, she said, enrolling in coverage isn\u2019t as urgent as some of her other needs.\n\n\u201cMedical insurance is definitely a top priority for me,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I also need a roof over my head.\u201d\n\nIn California, another factor may be at play. The Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpublic charge\u201d policy may be having an outsize impact on Medi-Cal enrollment because of the state\u2019s large immigrant population, said Hamutal Bernstein, a researcher at the Urban Institute. The rule allows federal immigration officials to more easily deny permanent residency status to those who depend on certain public benefits such as Medicaid.\n\n\u201cA lot of immigrant families are being disproportionately impacted by economic and health hardship and are increasingly needing some of this assistance,\u201d Bernstein said. But \u201ca lot of people are afraid of getting any kind of help.\u201d\n\nFederal rules also prevent the state from kicking anyone off Medicaid during the pandemic, which means people who normally would have fallen off the program will stay enrolled, contributing to the state\u2019s inflated projections, Williams said.\n\nThe department said it is working to get out the word that Medi-Cal is available, but Mitchell is urging the state to do more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned not enough outreach is being done,\u201d she said. \u201cWe expect people to magically know they may qualify for Medi-Cal and they should go online and apply.\u201d\n\nThis KHN story first published on California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.

New York has 32,520 confirmed deaths; California\u2019s about 8,000. California, with a population of 40 million, is about twice the size of New York.

The move is a significant blow to the campaign, which had hoped to use the convention to reset his presidential campaign.\n\n\u2013 John Fritze, Courtney Subramanian and Michael Collins\n\nUS hits 4 million cases of COVID-19\n\nThe U.S. hit the latest bleak milestone Thursday in the historic and deadly pandemic: 4 million confirmed cases of infections.\n\nAnd experts agree the number of cases is actually much greater \u2014 potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported, according to federal data.\n\nMeanwhile, almost 150,000 people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus as the nation continues to lead the world for most cases and deaths.\n\n\"We are still knee-deep in the first wave of this,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said in a Facebook Live interview July 6. \"And I would say, this would not be considered a wave. It was a surge, or a resurgence of infections superimposed upon a baseline.\"\n\n\u2013 Khrysgiana Pineda\n\nHawaiian Airlines flight attendant dies after testing positive for COVID-19\n\nA Hawaiian Airlines flight attendant died after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month in California, following an employee training at the airline's headquarters.\n\nHawaiian Airlines President & CEO Peter Ingram told employees in an internal memo distributed on Tuesday that Jeff Kurtzman, a senior Los Angeles-based flight attendant, died this week.\n\nHe had been a part of the airline since 1986, \"and over the past three decades had become well known to his in-flight colleagues for his passion for discovering new places, people and cultures; his terrific sense of humor and knack for easy conversation; and his caring heart,\" Ingram wrote in the memo, obtained by USA TODAY.\n\n\u2013 David Oliver\n\nHours before opening night, Nationals star Juan Soto tests positive for COVID-19\n\nMajor League Baseball\u2019s prime-time return amid the COVID-19 pandemic was dealt an unsettling blow when one of its greatest young stars tested positive before he could take the field in 2020.\n\nJuan Soto, the Washington Nationals\u2019 dazzling 21-year-old outfielder, was omitted from the opening-day roster after a positive test for COVID-19, general manager Mike Rizzo confirmed Thursday, just hours before the defending World Series champions opened the season with a nationally-televised game against the New York Yankees.\n\nRizzo says Soto is asymptomatic after taking the test Tuesday and receiving the results Thursday morning, and says no other Nationals will be unavailable for the opener due to contact tracing ramifications.\n\n\u2013 Gabe Lacques\n\nGOP to reveal $1T stimulus plan; Dems back $600 weekly jobless bonus\n\nSenate Republicans were scrambling Thursday to finalize a $1 trillion coronavirus relief package that will include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks and additional funding to help schools recover from the pandemic.\n\nGOP leaders and the White House said late Wednesday that they had agreed on key parts of the legislation, which will serve as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who have already passed their own bill in the House.\n\nBut Republicans are still struggling to put the finishing touches on the package. Congress and the White House are under pressure to clinch a deal on a fresh pandemic aid package; a federal program of expanded unemployment benefits is set to run out within days.\n\nOne item that will be missing from the GOP plan is President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut. Republicans abandoned that proposal even though Trump had suggested he might not sign any bill that doesn\u2019t include it.\n\n\u2013 Michael Collins\n\nIowa health officials draw scrutiny over meatpacking plant outbreak\n\nThe first confirmed coronavirus outbreak at an Iowa meatpacking plant was far more severe than previously known, with more than twice as many workers infected than the state Department of Public Health told the public, newly released records show.\n\nThe department said in May that 221 employees at the Tyson Foods pork processing plant in Columbus Junction tested positive. But days earlier, Tyson officials told Iowa workplace safety regulators that 522 plant employees had been infected, documents show. The discrepancy adds to mounting questions state officials face about public information during the pandemic.\n\nTyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said the number of infections announced by the state appeared to reflect only the first round of testing. \u201cCoordinating facility-wide testing and obtaining results is a complex process that takes time,\u201d he said.\n\nMoms with COVID-19 can safely breastfeed newborns, study suggests\n\nMothers with COVID-19 may be able to stay in the same room with their newborns after birth and not transmit the virus if certain precautions are taken. Researchers observed 120 babies born to mothers with COVID-19 and found no cases of transmission during childbirth or after two weeks of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact, according to the small study published Thursday in the journal The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.\n\n\u201cWe know that skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding are important both for mother-infant bonding and for long-term child health,\u201d said Dr. Patricia DeLaMora, who co-led the study from the Weill Cornell Medicine-New York Presbyterian Komansky Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cOur findings suggest that babies born to mothers with COVID-19 infection can still benefit from these safely.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nParent company of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, shuttering 1,600 stores\n\nThe parent company of Lane Bryant, Ann Taylor and the Justice brand is the latest in a line of retail corporations battered by the pandemic to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. New Jersey-based Ascena Retail Group, which also operates Ann Taylor Loft, Catherines, Lou & Grey and Cacique, plans to \"reduce their store fleet from approximately 2,800 stores to approximately 1,200 stores,\" the company said in court records Thursday. The planned closures are a 56% \"reduction in the total store fleet.\"\n\nBrooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus, Sur La Table and J. Crew have all filed for Chapter 11 since May. As many as 25,000 stores could shutter this year as businesses continue to feel the impacts of the pandemic, according to a report from Coresight Research.\n\n\u2013 Kelly Tyko\n\nMiddlemen banking billions off COVID-19 products\n\nMiddlemen seeking to profit from the pandemic have sprung up overnight to score billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 contracts, their stake as small as a mailbox rental or virtual office subscription. Some simply buy it from a manufacturer and resell it directly to the government at a steep markup. Global demand for personal protective equipment has attracted hundreds of construction, financing and technology companies to supplying health care products. One in 10 federal COVID-19 vendors are government contracting newcomers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly opportunism,\u201d said Benjamin Brunjes, an assistant professor at the Daniel J.

From Brooklyn, Fauci grew up a Yankees fan but says he roots for both teams since moving to the D.C. area. He's worn a Nats-themed mask to testify before a House Committee with other members of the coronavirus task force.\n\n\"Dr. Fauci has been a true champion for our country during the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout his distinguished career,\" the team said in a statement. \"It is only fitting that we honor him as we kick off the 2020 season and defend our World Series Championship title.\"\n\n\u2013 Analis Bailey\n\n'Cuomo Chips' won't cut it as a food order in New York bars\n\nSorry, bars and restaurants: You can't get around New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's food-with-alcohol order by offering a bag of \"Cuomo Chips\" or a few pieces of cheese. The State Liquor Authority updated its guidance to provide more clarity on Cuomo's order, which prevents bars and restaurants from serving alcoholic beverages to patrons who don't order food first. The order, issued last week, is meant to keep patrons in their seats and not congregating in groups around a bar or in an outdoor dining space. After bars began offering $1 chips and similar items as the food, the State Liquor Authority stepped in. Now the food must be \"sandwiches, soups or other foods, whether fresh, processed, precooked or frozen.\"\n\n\u2013 Jon Campbell\n\nUSA TODAY panel of experts: We're almost halfway to an available vaccine\n\nPropelled by encouraging results from early experiments, the clock has ticked forward one hour since June in USA TODAY\u2019s countdown to a vaccine against COVID-19. For July, the hands sit at 5 a.m., our panel of experts estimates. Midnight is the starting point of the pandemic in the U.S., and noon is the time a vaccine will be widely available to Americans. The panel includes experts in medicine, virology, immunology, logistics and supply chain issues.\n\n\u201cThese first steps simply mean that we haven\u2019t fallen at the first hurdle,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of immunization education with the Immunization Action Coalition. \"That doesn\u2019t change the number of hurdles ahead.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Elizabeth Weise and Karen Weintraub\n\nFlorida, Texas among states with deadliest weeks\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of Johns Hopkins data through late Wednesday shows 12 states set records for new cases over a seven-day period while six states had a record number of deaths over the period. New case records were set in Alaska, California, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Record numbers of deaths were reported in Florida, Idaho, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nIn Florida, the week's death toll was 824, more than twice the number of any week during the spring COVID-19 surge. Still, Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to press for in-classroom learning when schools open, some in less than three weeks. DeSantis stressed that young people face the least risk from the virus.\n\n\"It is our kids who have borne the harshest burden of the controlled measures instituted to protect against the virus,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday.\n\n\u2013 Michael Stucka\n\nRemote learning gaining momentum as back-to-school season approaches\n\nAs COVID-19 cases rise in most states, the prospect of in-person learning this fall at the country's major school districts is becoming increasingly remote. Eleven of the top 15 school systems by enrollment are already planning to start the fall semester online or implement a hybrid of in-person and online classes, according to Education Week magazine's reopening tracker. In all, 11 of the 15 largest U.S. school systems are in communities adding COVID-19 cases at more than three times the rate they were in the two weeks ending May 1.\n\nAmong colleges, the Chronicle of Higher Education is tracking the reopening plans of more than 1,200 institutions. The findings: About half of universities plan to reopen, a third are proposing a mix of online and in-person classes, and 11% have committed to fully online learning.\n\n\u2013 Elinor Aspegren and Chris Quintana\n\n1.4 million jobless claims filed, first increase since March\n\nAfter slowly dropping for over four months, the number of Americans filing new unemployment claims pushed higher last week, the Labor Department reported. More than 1.4 million Americans filed initial applications for unemployment insurance last week. That's far below the record 6.9 million who sought assistance in late March, but higher than the 1.3 million who filed claims the week before.

New York currently has over 412,800 total cases and is adding on average 700 new cases a day in July while California is rising by an average of 8,300 cases a day.\n\nSince its crush of cases earlier this year, New York state has gotten the virus under control, reporting the fewest hospitalizations in four months on Monday.\n\nLast week, California\u2019s Governor Gavin Newsom rolled back some of his reopening plans for the state by announcing the closure of some indoor venues that attract crowds such as bars, restaurants, movie theaters, zoos and museums.

The U.S. counted more than 1,000 deaths on Thursday, with more than 500 of them taking place in Florida, California and Texas. The U.S. death toll is now 144,780, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University,\n\nThe U.S. added more than 69,900 cases on Thursday to push the total above 4 million, according to a New York Times tracker. The spread has accelerated through the summer, climbing to 4 million from 3 million in just 15 days, as the Washington Post reported. In the early days of the outbreak it took 45 days to increase from 1 million to 2 million cases, and then took 27 days to rise to 3 million.\n\nForty states have seen rising cases in the last 14 days, according to the Times tracker, led by Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards told reporters at a briefing that his state is nearing breaking point after its case tally rose above 100,000.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House Task Force created to manage the pandemic, took a more somber tone than usual on Friday on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to make it clear to the American public: What we have now are essentially three New Yorks, with these three major states,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re really having to respond as an American people, and that\u2019s why you hear us calling for masks and increased social distancing to really stop the spread of this epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe face mask issue continued to be a thorny issue with the American public with legal challenges against mandates extending to Oregon on Thursday, when conservative group Freedom Foundation filed a suit against Gov. Kate Brown.\n\n\u201cGovernors in left-leaning states all over the country are making up the rules as they go \u2013 and ignoring the procedural rules their own state laws set up,\u201d Jason Dudash, the Freedom Foundation\u2019s Oregon director, said in a statement on the group\u2019s website.\n\nLast week, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over her face mask mandate. Several Georgia cities have also filed suits, while counties and districts in other states, including California, have also launched suits.\n\nPublic health experts have stressed that wearing face masks is key to containing the virus, along with frequent hand washing and social distancing. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, said at a recent news conference that if every American agreed to wear a mask, \u201cover the next six weeks we could drive (the virus) into the ground.\u201d\n\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania, an oncologist, bioethicist and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, reiterated his concern that the U.S. has squandered the last four months, \u201cand it really is very, very depressing,\u201d he said in an interview on MSNBC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really right back in March,\u201d he said.\n\nLatest tallies\n\nThe global death tally from COVID-19 stands at 634,954, the Johns Hopkins data shows, and at least 8.9 million people have recovered.\n\nBrazil is second to the U.S. with 2.3 million cases and 84,082 deaths.\n\nIndia is third measured by cases at 1.3 million, followed by Russia with 799,499 and South Africa with 408,052.\n\nThe U.K. has 299,500 cases and 45,762 fatalities, the highest in Europe and third highest in the world.\n\nChina, where the illness was first reported late last year, has 86,177 cases and 4,650 fatalities.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economy saying?\n\nThere was good news on the housing front Friday, when data showed sales of new single-family homes rose sharply in June for the second straight month, pushing the sales rate to its highest level in 13 years, as MarketWatch\u2019s Greg Robb reported.\n\nThe annual sales pace for U.S. new-home sales rose 13.8% last month to 776,000, the Commerce Department said Friday. That\u2019s above the prior cycle high of 774,000 hit in January and is the strongest since July 2007, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had expected a June sales rate of 710,000, compared with an original May estimate of 676,000. On Friday, the government revised May\u2019s rate to 682,000. That pushed the May rise in new home sales to 19.4%\n\n\u201cThe impact of falling mortgage rates \u2014 down 80 basis points this year \u2014 is more than offsetting the wave of Covid-induced job losses, which seem to be hitting younger renters rather than would-be homebuyers; the median buyer is 47 years of age, while the median restaurant employee is 29,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nSee: America is facing an eviction crisis as moratoriums expire: \u2018This is a potential catastrophe\u2019\n\nA separate report found the service sector lagging behind manufacturing, as some areas of the country have reimposed lockdown measures.\n\nIHS Markit said its U.S. flash manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 51.3 in July from 49.8 in the previous month. The flash services purchasing managers index rose only to 49.6 from 47.9 in June.\n\nAny reading above 50.0 indicates improving conditions, while readings below that measure indicate contraction.

And economists are concerned because some key service sectors like travel, restaurants, and entertainment are not expected to recover soon given the pandemic. Manufacturing is slowly getting on its feet but is still experiencing headwinds.\n\n\u201cThe lack of growth is a disappointment,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.\n\nWhat are companies saying?\n\nThree Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA components reported earnings, starting late Thursday with chip giant Intel Corp., which disappointed with news of a delay in its next generation of semiconductor technology, MarketWatch\u2019s Jon Swartz reported. Intel said it may actually use a third party to manufacture it as a contingency plan.\n\nIntel US:INTC stock was slammed after it reported along with second-quarter earnings that the introduction of its 7-nanometer chips would be delayed by at least six months. AMD US:AMD is already selling 7-nm semiconductors for servers and PCs; in chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, is the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power.\n\n\u201cWe have identified a defect mode in our 7-nanometer process that resulted in yield degradation,\u201d said Bob Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive, on a conference call late Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve root-caused the issue and believe there are no fundamental roadblocks, but we have also invested in contingency plans to hedge against further schedule uncertainty.\u201d\n\nSee now: Intel admits another defeat with unprecedented manufacturing issues\n\nThere was better news from American Express Co. US:AXP, which posted a surprise profit for the second quarter, but revenue that lagged estimates amid a fall in card member spending during the pandemic.\n\nVerizon Communications US:VZ beat on profit and revenue but its report showed negative impacts from the pandemic. The wireless operator estimates that both GAAP and adjusted EPS saw negative impacts of about 14 cents stemming from impacts to wireless service revenue and lower advertising and search revenue for Verizon\u2019s media unit.\n\nElsewhere, there was a setback for Moderna Inc. US:MRNA, one of the many companies working on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of Arbutus Biopharma Corp. US:ABUS in a patent dispute between the companies, MarketWatch\u2019s Jaimy Lee reported.\n\nThe decision may mean that Arbutus will attempt to make a royalty claim to products developed by Moderna\u2019s lipid nanoparticle delivery technology, which is currently being used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSVB Leerink\u2019s Mani Foroohar said the ruling is a \u201cdisappointing turn\u201d for Moderna, and \u201cany meaningful royalty burden could hamper MRNA\u2019s pricing flexibility and margin profile vs. other players in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine market.\u201d\n\nWhat It Would Take to Reach Herd Immunity for the Coronavirus\n\nHere\u2019s the latest news on companies and COVID-19:\n\n\u2022 Fans of the iPhone will probably have to wait at least another month before shiny new models are unveiled. Apple Inc. US:AAPL is delaying its annual fall event until the latter half of October instead of early September, according to a tech blog. The company was forced to push back the event for the 5G-compatible iPhone 12 line because of production delays caused by the pandemic, the Japanese Apple blog Mac Otakara reported. Apple is expected to announce four new iPhones, with the 5G models available in November.\n\n\u2022 Boston Beer Co. US:SAM, maker of Sam Adams and other alcoholic beverages, reported an unexpected doubling of profit from the year before amid the pandemic. Chief Executive Dave Burwick credited \u201cincreases in our Truly Hard Seltzer and Twisted Tea brands and the addition of the Dogfish Head brands\u201d for some of the demand gains. Boston Beer now expects full-year earnings of $11.70 to $12.70 a share, while analysts on average had forecast 2020 earnings of $9.84 a share.\n\n\u2022 eHealth Inc. US:EHTH, an online health insurance marketplace, reported an adjusted quarterly profit and sales that came in above expectations. Revenue rose 35% to $88.8 million. The company said the number of new paying members for all its Medicare products rose 40% to 72,651 people. \u2022\n\n\u2022 ETrade Financial Corp. US:ETFC reported fiscal second-quarter results that slightly exceeded Wall Street estimates. The company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents a share.\n\n\u2022 Honeywell International Inc. US:HON reported second-quarter profit and sales that fell, but beat expectations. The company said it expects sales challenges resulting from the pandemic will continue, particularly in the aerospace and oil and gas businesses. Aerospace sales declined 28% to $2.54 billion, but topped the FactSet consensus of $2.41 billion; performance materials and technologies sales declined 19% to $2.22 billion but topped expectations of $2.19 billion; safety and productivity sales slipped 1% to $1.54 billion to beat expectations of $1.43 billion; and building technologies sales shed 19% to $1.18 billion, missing expectations of $1.24 billion.\n\n\u2022 Toy maker Mattel Inc. US:MAT reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss and sales that were higher than Wall Street expected, thanks to sales in North America and total sales of Barbie and other dolls and games. Online sales \u201ccontinued to grow strongly in all regions.\u201d Gross sales in North America increased 3%, primarily on sales of Barbies as well as action figures, building sets, and games, the company said. Sales of its toy vehicles, including Hot Wheels, fell, the company said. Mattel said its supply chain continued to perform well despite temporary closures connected to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cCurrently all of our factories are open with minimal disruption to operations, as we enter the peak production season,\u201d it said. Liquidity is expected to be enough \u201cto effectively manage through the COVID-19 disruption and to continue to execute our strategy,\u201d the company said.\n\n\u2022 Paramount Pictures will delay the release of two of its most anticipated movies, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d and \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d to 2021 due to the pandemic. The \u201cQuiet Place\u201d sequel is now scheduled for April 23, 2021, and the \u201cTop Gun\u201d sequel is on tap for July 2, 2021. Paramount is a unit of ViacomCBS Inc. US:VIAC\n\n\u2022 ScanSource Inc. US:SCSC, a provider of barcode, networking, security and business communications services, provided an upbeat sales outlook, while also saying it will cut jobs as part of a expense-reduction plan. The company expects fiscal fourth-quarter net sales of $758 million, compared with the FactSet consensus for total revenue of $718 million. ScanSource announced a $30 million cost cutting plan, which will include a reduction of its North America workforce, salary reductions of 10% to 25% for its executive team, elimination of cash retainers for the board of directors for the rest of the year and cutting discretionary spending. The company is closing its Canpango professional services business, which it acquired in August 2018, which is expected to result in a $2 million charge.\n\n\u2022 Schlumberger Ltd. US:SLB swung to a multibillion-dollar loss in the second quarter and revenue fell short of estimates, as the twin effects of the pandemic and falling oil price weighed. \u201cThis has probably been the most challenging quarter in past decades,\u201d Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch said, as he announced 21,000 job cuts. Revenue fell 28% from the first quarter, \u201ccaused by the unprecedented fall in North America activity, and international activity drop due to downward revisions to customer budgets accentuated by COVID-19 disruptions. This speaks volumes about an industry confronted with historic oil demand and supply imbalances caused by demand destruction from the global COVID-19 containment effort.\u201d The company is reorganizing and combining its 17 product lines into four divisions, restructuring geographically around five key basins of activity and streamlining management, he said. Schlumberger expects to remove $1.5 billion of costs permanently. \u201cLooking at the macro view in the near-term, oil demand is slowly starting to normalize and is expected to improve as government measures support consumption,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cHowever, subsequent waves of potential COVID-19 resurgence pose a negative risk to this outlook.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Skechers USA Inc. US:SKX reported a narrower-than-expected adjusted second-quarter loss and sales that were above expectations. \u201cSkechers, like most businesses around the world, has never faced a more challenging time than during the pandemic, which caused the closing of nearly every market worldwide,\u201d Chief Executive Robert Greenberg said. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents around $1.6 billion, thanks in part to drawing down $490 million from its credit facility in the first quarter. The company did not provide an outlook.\n\n\u2022 Office supply equipment retailer Staples became the latest to require face coverings in all its stores starting Monday. Staples is an essential retailer, selling hand sanitizer and other personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as equipment for working and schooling from home. Staples joins retailers like Walmart Inc. US:WMT and Target Corp. US:TGT that will require customers to wear face coverings in stores.\n\nSee also: Christopher Nolan blockbuster \u2018Tenet\u2019 now delayed indefinitely due to coronavirus\n\n\u2022 Walt Disney Co.\u2019s US:DIS \u201cMulan\u201d \u2014 scheduled for release Aug. 21, and expected to be a summer blockbuster \u2014 has been delayed indefinitely because of theater closures and production shutdowns caused by the pandemic.

{"title": "California Gov. Newsom orders statewide closures, including indoor restaurant operations", "publish_date": "07-13-2020 00:00", "text": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif. \u2013 California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday a list of business sectors that will be required to close as the number of coronavirus cases continue to increase substantially across the state.\n\nCalifornia's average daily new cases hit 8,211 over the past week and 23 people died because of virus-related complications in the past 24 hours.\n\nAll counties are required to close indoor operations of restaurants, wineries, tasting rooms, movie theaters, family entertainment centers, zoos, museums, card rooms and all bars.\n\nThe 30 counties that are on the state\u2019s targeted engagement list are ordered to close additional businesses. The targeted counties, which account for 80% of the state\u2019s population, are also required to close indoor operations of fitness centers, places of worship, offices for noncritical sectors, personal hair services, and indoor malls.\n\nThe state's engagement list details counties that are struggling to contain the spread of the virus. A week ago, just 23 counties were on this list. Placer, Sonoma, Sutter and Yuba counties were added to the list today.\n\nNewsom expects two additional counties to be added in the coming days.\n\nCoronavirus updates:LA and San Diego school districts will start fall classes online only; California orders statewide closures\n\nSurging ICU usage prompts re-closures\n\nAs intensive care bed usage continues to surge across the state \u2013 ICU capacity in Riverside County hit 100% on Friday \u2013 Newsom says his actions will become more aggressive.\n\nAbout 36% of the states total ICU beds remain available. In Placer, Lake and Butte counties, less than 20% of ICU beds are available, Newsom says.\n\nCoronavirus:California may release 10% of inmates in pandemic response\n\n\"This continues to be a deadly disease,\" he said on Monday. \"This continues to be a disease that puts people in our ICUs, in our hospitals and is currently putting a strain on our hospital system. ... We're starting to see in some rural parts of the state an increase in ICU use that is generating some concern.\"\n\nAcross the state, COVID-19 hospitalizations increased 28% over a two-week period, which is better than the 50% increase presented about a week ago. However, officials expect to see another surge in cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks because of the July 4 holiday.\n\n\"When you start to see ... constraint in terms of ICU beds an additional increase in use and utilization in ventilators it then draws our attention. The data then bears a consequence. The consequence being the data driving the decision to utilize that dimmer switch,\" Newsom said.\n\nHow did California get here?\n\nThis \"dimming\" of the economy, as Newsom refers to the closures, comes after his administration allowed counties to reopen before they were prepared.\n\nOf the 49 counties that were allowed to follow a quicker path in mid-May, 49% failed to meet at least one of the reopening criteria mandated by the state, according to an analysis by The Palm Springs Desert Sun of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAt that time, nearly a third of the counties that received the green light didn\u2019t have enough contact tracers, and more than 20% were failing to conduct enough coronavirus tests on a daily basis.\n\nNewsom on Monday acknowledged that testing in California is currently \"inadequate\" to meet the needs of the state. He said it is \"unacceptable\" that the state is not able to do more widespread testing. Just last week, San Bernardino County canceled 11,000 coronavirus tests because of a supply shortage.\n\nCounties began to show signs of struggle in June, as cases began increasing as a result of the reopening. Newsom said if counties didn't shape up, the state would step in, and gave a two-week deadline from the date they were initially placed on the targeted engagement list.\n\nHowever, eight counties \u2060\u2013 home to 35% of the state\u2019s population \u2060\u2013 were allowed to blow past that deadline, according to a Desert Sun analysis, and the state took no concrete action.\n\nIt wasn't until early July that the state took action, threatening to withhold funding from counties and closing bars ahead of the Fourth of July weekend in counties on the watch list.\n\nNow, Newsom says he plans to use the \"dimmer switch ... a little bit more forcefully.\"\n\nThe governor acknowledged that the state was able to control the spread of the virus following the initial sweeping stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"We were able to suppress the spread of this virus, we were able to knock down the growth of this in the beginning. We are going to do that again, there is no doubt in my mind,\" he said.\n\nFollow reporter Nicole Hayden on Twitter @Nicole_A_Hayden.\n\nBack to the office? Or WFH?

That's the third-highest number of new daily cases the country has reported yet and the highest since late April, according to the Times. Cities and states across the U.S. are suspending reopening plans as cases begin to spike, according to The New York Times. North Carolina paused reopening such that it will remain in phase 2 for three more weeks, according to a statement from the North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. He also required face coverings in public places.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is relying on the data and the science to lift restrictions responsibly, and right now our increasing numbers show we need to hit the pause button while we work to stabilize our trends,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWe need to all work together so we can protect our families and neighbors, restore our economy, and get people back to work and our children back to school.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Texas reported 5,489 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, a record number of daily coronavirus cases for the state and ICU beds in Houston reached 97% of normal capacity, according to The Guardian. \u201cWe want to make sure that everyone reinforces the best safe practices of wearing a mask, hand sanitization, maintaining safe distance, but importantly, because the spread is so rampant right now, there\u2019s never a reason for you to have to leave your home,\u201d Texas Governor Greg Abbott told local news station KBTX-TV on Tuesday, according to The Guardian. \u201cUnless you do need to go out, the safest place for you is at your home.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Beginning tonight at midnight, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut will require that people traveling from hotspot states quarantine for 14 days, according to CNN.

Currently, this travel advisory is for people coming from Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas. Each of the three states will be responsible for enforcing this quarantine. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said this travel advisory was voluntary but \"urgent guidance,\" while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said violations would lead to a judicial order and mandatory quarantine. In New York, fines are $2,000 for the first violation, $5,000 for the second and $10,000 if harm is caused, according to CNN. When it comes to fines, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the health commissioner \"has within her powers to directly address an individual who is non-compliant,\" according to CNN.\n\nThe U.S. reported a record-number of new coronavirus cases yesterday, two months after the previous record\n\n\u2014 There have now been more than 9.4 million COVID-19 cases worldwide and more than 483,200 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In the U.S., there have been more than 2.3 million COVID-19 cases and more than 121,900 deaths; In Brazil, there have been more than 1.2 million COVID-19 cases and more than 53,800 deaths; In Russia, there have been more than 613,100 COVID-19 cases and more than 8,500 deaths, according to the dashboard.\n\n\u2014 In the U.S., coronavirus cases continue to increase across dozens of states, according to The New York Times.

According to the CDC, people of any age who have chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; have an immunocompromised state from a solid organ transplant; are obese; have serious heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies; have sickle cell disease; or have type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. People might be at an increased risk from severe illness if they have moderate to severe asthma; cerebrovascular disease; cystic fibrosis; hypertension or high blood pressure; are immunocompromised from blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids or use of other immune weakening medicines; have neurological conditions such as dementia; have liver disease; are pregnant; have pulmonary fibrosis; smoke; have a type of blood disorder called thalassemia; or have type 1 diabetes mellitus, according to the CDC.\n\n\u2014 New York City is on track to enter phase 3 of reopening, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today, according to The New York Times.

The four indicators that the model uses to assess how at risk a state is of COVID-19 is: Are COVID cases decreasing? Are we testing enough? Are our hospitals ready? Are we tracing fast enough (i.e. finding and isolating new cases before the virus spreads)? While those four states are \"on track to contain covid-19,\" the rest of the states have a higher covid risk either having an \"active or imminent outbreak\" to being \"at risk\" of an outbreak to having \"controlled disease growth.\"\n\nTexas suspends reopening, CDC director says the number of people infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. is likely 10 times higher than official count\n\n\u2014 Texas is pausing reopening, Gov. Greg Abbott said today, according to CNBC. However, businesses that were already allowed to reopen can continue to stay open at designated occupancies, according to a statement from the Texas Department of State Health Services, CNBC reported. For example, restaurants, gyms, retailers, professional sports, bars and other venues were allowed to reopen with a limited capacity in May, according to CNBC. \u201cThe last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u2014 The number of people in the U.S. have been infected with the coronavirus is likely 10 times higher than the current confirmed number of cases, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield said today. \u201cOur best estimate right now is that for every case that\u2019s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,\" he said, The Washington Post reported. There are currently 2.3 million confirmed cases in the U.S., so if this is the case, there would be at least 23 million cases across the country, according to the Post.\n\nNew Delhi plans to test all of its residents for the coronavirus, Texas, Florida and Arizona pause reopening plans amid alarming rise in cases\n\n\u2014 As India\u2019s coronavirus case counts nearly reaches 500,000, officials in New Delhi are planning to test all 29 million of its residents for the coronavirus across a span of 10 days, according to The New York Times. More than 15,000 people have died from the coronavirus in India, according to the Times. New Delhi has more than 70,000 cases of the coronavirus and officials will start going house to house and conducting blood tests starting on Saturday and ending by July 6, according to the Times. That means each three-person team will cover at least 50 of the city\u2019s 4.5 million households a day, according to the Times.\n\n\u2014 There have now been more than 9.6 million COVID-19 cases around the word and more than 489,900 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Dashboard. There have been more than 2.4 million cases in the U.S. and more than 124,400 deaths; more than 1.2 million cases in Brazil and more than 54,900 deaths; and more than 619,900 cases in Russia and more than 8,700 deaths.\n\n\u2014 Texas, Florida and Arizona all paused their reopening plans as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations increased to alarming levels, according to The Washington Post. Yesterday, state health departments reported 39,327 new infections, a record number of new infections, according to the Post.\n\nTexas and Florida shut down on-site consumption of alcohol at bars amid record-breaking number of coronavirus cases\n\n\u2014 16 NBA players out of 302 total tested positive for the coronavirus, The National Basketball Players Association announced today. Any player who tests positive will remain in self-isolation until satisfying public health protocols to stop isolation and being cleared by a physician, according to the statement. The NBA is set to restart on July 30 in Orlando, Florida and players who participate in voluntary workouts will be tested every other day starting next week, according to Axios.\n\n\u2014 Amid a surge in cases, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott said all bars are required to close by noon on Friday, though they can still offer delivery and takeout (including alcoholic beverages), according to his executive order. Restaurants can remain open for dining inside at 50% indoor capacity, rafting and tubing businesses must close and most outdoor gatherings of 100 or more people must be approved by local governments, according to his order. Texas recorded 5,996 cases on Thursday, a record-number, according to the Texas Tribune. The state also reported a record number of hospitalizations: 4,739, according to the Tribune.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars. The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and enhance public health. We want this to be as limited in duration as possible. However, we can only slow the spread if everyone in Texas does their part,\" Abbott said in the order. \"Every Texan has a responsibility to themselves and their loved ones to wear a mask, wash their hands, stay six feet apart from others in public, and stay home if they can.\"\n\n\u2014 Today, Florida reported 8,942 new COVID-19 cases, a record number of cases, smashing the previous record of 5,508 on Wednesday, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Florida shut down on-site alcohol consumption at bars \"effective immediately,\" Florida Department of Business & Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears tweeted around 11 am.\n\n\u2014 The U.S. may start conducting \"pooled testing\" as COVID-19 spreads, according to a new Live Science report. To improve the tracking of the coronavirus spread, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might approve broader use of \"pooled testing\" which would mean that diagnostic tests can be processed in batches (tests from five to 10 people could be tested together) rather than one at a time, according to the report. If the pooled sample comes back negative, no additional testing is needed for the people in the group but if it comes back positive, samples must be retested one by one to pinpoint who was infected, according to the report. But this approach would likely only work if just a small proportion of the population is infected because if too many people were infected, then too many pooled samples would test positive and require further testing, meaning that pooled testing wouldn't lead to a net decrease in total tests required, according to the report.\n\n\u2014 Yesterday, the U.S. recorded 40,184 new coronavirus cases, a record number of cases, according to another Live Science report. Some states are doing better than others. There are several indicators that can help determine whether a state or county is moving in the right direction or not, including test positivity rate which means the proportion of tests that turn up positive for COVID-19; daily number of hospitalizations which can reveal whether an area has the virus under controllable levels or not; burden on hospital systems to see if hospitals have the capacity to treat severe COVID-19 infections; and contact tracing which means how well an area is finding and isolating people infected with the coronavirus, according to the report.\n\n\u2014 Recently, the U.S., especially Florida, Texas and Arizona, has seen a marked increase in coronavirus cases among people under the age of 40, according to The Guardian. Though most prominently seen in the U.S., similar trends have been found recently in Israel and Portugal. Some are guessing that the younger age groups have evolved relaxed attitudes toward social distancing thinking that they are less likely to have severe disease (young people can still have severe disease), according to the Guardian. Others have said that this is due to better and more extensive testing that has been finding more mild cases\u2014 that might be attributed to younger people\u2014 than in the beginning of the pandemic, according to The Guardian.\n\nWorld nears 10 million cases, Egypt loosens lockdown, U.S. rolls back reopening\n\n\u2014Worldwide, COVID-19 infections have reached more than 9.8 million with 494,857 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard. The top countries have logged the following:\n\n-U.S.: Nearly 2.5 million cases and 125,039 deaths\n\n-Brazil: 1.27 million cases and 55,961 deaths\n\n-Russia: 626,779 cases and 8,958 deaths\n\n-India: 508,953 cases and 15,685 deaths\n\n-U.K.: 310,837 cases and 43,498 deaths\n\n\u2014Despite a continued uptick in COVID-19 cases, Egypt loosened many of its lockdown measures today. After being closed for more than three months, cafes, clubs, gyms and theaters have reopened, The Guardian reported. Mosques and churches also reopened. However, they aren't opened completely: Restaurants are allowed 25% seating capacity, and mosques and churches aren't allowed to hold the main weekly services, as those draw large crowds, The Guardian reported. To date, Egypt has recorded 62,755 cases and 2,620 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.\n\n\u2014Several U.S. states showing spikes in cases have rolled back reopening plans, with some posing more restrictions. For instance, in Texas and Florida, leaders have done a turnabout and set new restrictions on bars, The New York Times reported. \"If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars,\" Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said in an interview with KVIA-TV in El Paso on Friday (June 26), the Times reported. In Florida's Miami-Dade County, the mayor said he would close beaches from July 3 \u2014 July 7 ahead of any mass gatherings planned for the July Fourth weekend, the Times said. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has placed new restrictions on Imperial County, which borders Arizona and the Mexican state of Baja California and has the highest infection rate in the state, the Times reported.\n\n10x more infections than reported, 5% of NBA players test positive, Florida smashes more records\n\n\u2014There are 10 times more COVID-19 infections in some parts of the U.S. than being reported, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The New York Times reported. For instance, as of April 12, the prevalence of COVID-19 in South Florida was at just 1.85%, according to the CDC. That prevalence, however, is likely higher because of the current surge in infections, the Times said. The highest prevalence, of 6.93%, was found in the New York City as of April 1. \"This study underscores that there are probably a lot of people infected without knowing it, likely because they have mild or asymptomatic infection,\" said study leader Dr. Fiona Havers, the Times reported. \"But those people could still spread it to others.\" In addition, the study highlights the fact that even in the hardest-hit regions, the majority of people have yet to be infected.\n\n\u2014This week, 5% of NBA players tested positive for COVID-19, or 16 out of 302 players who were tested, the Wall Street Journal reported. Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, said that none of the players was seriously sick and that the NBA had anticipated this rate of infection. The basketball players will begin to move into a Walt Disney World campus, as the WSJ called it, on July 7, ahead of a July 30 start to the season. Any player who tests positive will quarantine until he meets certain guidelines and has been cleared by a doctor, the WSJ said. The NBA shut down on March 11, after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for the virus.\n\n\u2014Florida smashed records for new cases again Saturday (June 27), with 9,585 new COVID-19 cases, The Washington Post reported. The state's previous record was hit just yesterday, with 8,942 new cases. Even as Florida's virus numbers soar, Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted a push to make face coverings mandatory across the state. Even so, some areas such as Palm Beach County and cities in Miami-Dade County have announced their own requirements for face masks in public, the Post said.\n\n18 Texans test positive after attending surprise birthday party\n\nEighteen people who attended a surprise birthday party in North Texas have tested positive for COVID-19. The party, attended by 25 people and lasting just a few hours, has left one man's father fighting for his life in the ICU, Miami news station WSVN-TV reported.\n\n\"When people started getting sick, we really let everyone have it,\" Ron Barbosa, whose father is in the ICU, told WFAA-TV, as reported by WSVN-TV. \"We knew this was going to happen, I mean, this whole time this has been going on we've been terrified.\"\n\nBarbosa didn't attend the May 30 party for his daughter-in-law because he was concerned about COVID-19 transmission. Barbosa's mother, who just swung by the party to drop off something, also tested positive for the virus and had to be admitted to the hospital. Both of Barbosa's parents are in their 80s. His sister, who is battling breast cancer, also contracted the virus and has been hospitalized, WFAA-TV reported.\n\nApparently at the time, the partygoers were following the state's guidelines for lowering the risk of COVID-19, the news outlet reported. Amid a surge in cases and hospitalizations in the state, Gov. Greg Abbott halted the reopening of the state on Friday (June 26) and also rolled back some allowances \u2014 closing all bars again, for instance.\n\nYesterday, Texas recorded 6,079 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the state's total to 148,845, with 2,406 related deaths. The state's positivity rate \u2014 the percentage of tests turning out positive \u2014 is continuing an alarming rise and is now at about 13.7% (on a 7-day rolling average). An increasing positivity rate is a sign that transmission in your area is also increasing.\n\nWorld surpasses 500,000 deaths, as US shows alarming surge in cases\n\nThe world has surpassed another grim milestone: 10 million cases of COVID-19, with related deaths reaching more than a half-million, according to Worldometer and the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard. The global death toll from the virus had just passed 100,000 in April, just a month after the World Health Organization had declared a COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times reported. That death toll more than doubled, reaching 250,000 in early May. And now in under two months, the number has doubled again.\n\nAbout 25% of those deaths or 128,433 occurred in the United States, with about 8% of the known deaths or 57,658 being reported in Brazil. The United Kingdom has also confirmed an alarming death toll, at 43,550 deaths related to COVID-19, according to Worldometer.\n\nThe U.S. in particular is showing worrisome signs in certain states. Across the country, COVID-19 cases have risen 65 percent over the past two weeks, the Times reported. On Saturday (June 27) alone, more than 43,000 cases were confirmed in the U.S., according to Worldometer. Florida, Nevada and South Carolina broke single-day records for most new cases, the Times said.\n\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott warned that the virus in the state had taken a \"very swift and a very dangerous turn,\" the Times reported. Vice President Mike Pence visited the state today, donning a face mask; he stressed the importance of wearing masks.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, also urged Texans to put on face masks and avoid close contact with others, the Times said. \"I'm really appealing to every Texan to wear a mask,\" Birx said on Sunday. \"I'm just here really to ask every one of them to wear masks, every single one of them to wear a mask.\"\n\n'Window is closing' for the U.S. to get the pandemic under control, Alex Azar said on Sunday\n\n\u2014 The \"window is closing\" for the U.S. to get the pandemic under control, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"Things are very different from two months ago... So it is a very different situation, but this is a very, very serious situation and the window is closing for us to take action and get this under control,\" he said, according to CNN. Still, he said, the U.S. is in a better place to fight the pandemic, because of increased testing, contact tracing, hospital capacity, reserves of personal protective equipment and advances toward drugs and vaccines. If Americans \"act irresponsibly, if we don't socially distance, if we don't use face coverings in settings where we can't social distance, if we don't practice appropriate personal hygiene, we're going to see spread of disease,\" he said, according to CNN.\n\n\u2014 There are now more than 2.5 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. and more than 125,800 deaths, according to The Johns Hopkins dashboard. There are more than 10.1 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\n\u2014 Yesterday, due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, California ordered bars to close in Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, San Joaquin and Tulare counties, according to a tweet from California Governor Gavin Newsom. He also recommended that bars close in Contra Costa, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Stanislaus and Ventura counties.\n\nGilead Sciences puts price on remdesivir, coronavirus cases increas in much of the U.S., The pandemic 'is not even close to being over,' WHO director-general says\n\n\u2014 Gilead Sciences will charge $390 per vial of remdesivir, which equates to be $2,340 per treatment for one person, according to an open letter from Daniel O'Day, the chairman and CEO of Gilead Sciences. That's assuming that the majority of patients will use 6 vials of remdesivir across a span of 5 days. That pricing is for governments of developed countries including the U.S. government, and Medicaid, according to CNN. But for U.S. private insurance companies, the cost will be $520 per vial, or up to $3,120 per treatment, according to the statement. Uninsured patients would also be charged $520 per vial, according to The New York Times. In developing countries, the price will be lower, O'Day wrote in the statement.\n\nResults from a study conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on COVID-19 patients suggested that remdesivir shortened recovery time by four days, on average, O'Day wrote in the letter. So that would equate to hospital savings of about $12,000 per patient in the U.S., he wrote. \"Even just considering these immediate savings to the healthcare system alone, we can see the potential value that remdesivir provides. This is before we factor in the direct benefit to those patients who may have a shorter stay in the hospital,\" O'Day wrote.\n\nRemdesivir, a drug originally developed to treat Ebola has been shown to improve recovery times for COVID-19 patients in clinical trials. It is currently the only drug that has emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus patients, according to CNN.\n\n\u2014 Coronavirus cases are increasing in much of the U.S., and in many of those places, the number of people hospitalized and the percentage of people testing positive are also increasing which is telling that the spikes aren't the sole result of increased testing, according to The New York Times. New cases are decreasing in just seven places: Maryland, Rhode Island, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, South Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to a Times analysis. Case counts have mostly stayed the same in the last 14 days in New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Virginia, Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota, Maine and Guam. In the majority of states, case counts have increased in the last 14 days. Cases are increasing in California, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Washington, South Carolina, Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Utah, Arkansas, Nevada, Kentucky, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Delaware, Oregon, Idaho, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alaska, Hawaii and Montana, according to The Times.\n\n\u2014 The pandemic \"is not even close to being over,\" World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom said during a media briefing today. Tomorrow will be six months since the WHO first received reports of a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases in China, he said. \"Six months ago, none of us could have imagined how our world \u2013 and our lives \u2013 would be thrown into turmoil by this new virus.The pandemic has brought out the best and the worst of humanity,\" he said. Many countries have implemented measures to suppress transmission and save lives, he said. Those measures have slowed \u2014 but not stopped \u2014 the spread of the virus, he added. Now, as some countries reopen their economies and society, they are seeing a resurgence of cases, he said. \"Most people remain susceptible. The virus still has a lot of room to move. We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is: this is not even close to being over. Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,\" Adhanom said.\n\nNew Jersey won't resume indoor dining amid spikes in other states and Kansas will require people to wear masks in public places\n\n\u2014 Indoor dining in New Jersey will no longer resume on Thursday, according to a tweet from the state's Gov. Phil Murphy. The plan was to loosen restrictions but after COVID-19 spiked in other states \"driven by, in part, the return of indoor dining, we have decided to postpone indoor dining indefinitely,\" he wrote. \"We\u2019re also moved to pause indoor dining because of what we\u2019ve seen in some establishments across the state. Overcrowding. A complete disregard for social distancing. Very few, IF ANY, face coverings.The scenes we see in our newspapers and on social media CANNOT CONTINUE,\" he wrote in the Twitter thread. Many establishments' owners, managers and customers have been responsible in following guidance and protecting people from the virus, he wrote. But \"The carelessness of one establishment can completely undo the good work of many others,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We will not tolerate outlier bars and restaurants \u2013 and, frankly, patrons \u2013 who think the rules don\u2019t apply to them.\" The state, one of the hardest hit a couple of months ago, has had a total of 171,272 coronavirus cases. On Monday, the state reported 156 new cases, much lower than the approximate 3,000 new cases a day the state was recording for much of April, according to NPR.\n\n\u2014 People in Kansas will be required to wear face masks when around other people, starting this Friday (July 3) Gov.

The U.S., which is currently tallying nearly 40,000 new cases a day, is \"not in total control\" of the pandemic, he said. About 50% of cases are coming from Florida, California, Texas and Arizona, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t make an accurate prediction but it\u2019s going to be very disturbing,\u201d Fauci said in a hearing held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to CNBC. \u201cWe are now having 40-plus-thousand new cases a day.

Yesterday, there were 44,474 new COVID-19 cases reported across the U.S., according to The Washington Post.\n\n\u2014 A new study conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that more than half of U.S. COVID-19 patients in a recent survey couldn\u2019t identify another person with the disease whom they had close contact with before getting sick, according to a Live Science report. In other words, many Americans with COVID-19 don\u2019t know how they were infected. The survey was conducted as a telephone interview with 350 adults in nine states who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 31 and May 10, according to the report. The findings suggest that many people may be getting infected through community transmission and not from a familiar person in their lives, the CDC said, according to the report. This \"underscores the need for isolation of infected persons, contact tracing and testing \u2026 and prevention measures, including social distancing and use of cloth face coverings,\" while community transmission is ongoing, the authors said.\n\n\u2014 The total number of people who died in Scotland from any cause has returned back to normal levels, according to the BBC.

The virus, called G4 EA H1N1, is a genetic mix of the H1N1 \"swine flu,\" which caused a flu pandemic in 2009, and other flu viruses, the scientists reported in a new study published Monday (June 29) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The scientists found evidence that G4 EA H1N1 has infected workers on pig farms in China. But there\u2019s nothing to indicate that the virus spreads between people, according to the report. The authors caution that the virus is not an immediate health threat, but that controlling this virus in pig populations and monitoring for signs of it in humans \"should be urgently implemented,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMore than 50,000 new coronavirus cases were reported in a single day in the U.S.\n\n\u2014 For the first time, more than 50,000 new coronavirus cases were reported in a single day on Wednesday in the U.S., according to NPR.

Along with restaurants, hair salons and some other businesses that are also reopening, pubs will have to keep a 21-day record of all customers. In the instance of new cases, the government will be able to trace contacts and hopefully contain the outbreaks. About 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of London, Leicester will remain closed for business due to a regional outbreak of COVID-19, the Times said. The U.K. has the third highest death toll \u2014 44,080 deaths \u2014 related to the coronavirus pandemic and the sixth highest case count in the world, with the country logging 285,268 COVID-19 cases to date, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.\n\n\u2014Nursing home residents will get COVID-19 tests every month in the U.K., the Times reported, while staff will be tested weekly. About 5,126 of the country's nursing homes (or 56%) have reported at least one case of the virus and 20% of residents \u2014 and 7% of staff \u2014 at those facilities have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a survey by the country's Office for National Statistics. At least 15,500 nursing home residents have died from COVID-19 to date, according to the survey.\n\n\u2014The state of Texas is dealing with a health care system now bursting at the seams, after cases have surged there. The number of new daily cases is three times higher in Texas than it was in April. Over the past week, the state has been averaging nearly 6,300 cases a day, The Washington Post reported. To date, 183,044 Texans have tested positive for COVID-19 and 2,585 have died as a result, according to Worldometer, which collects data on coronavirus cases. According to the Post, the surge in Texas has led to \"overwhelmed testing centers, lines at emergency rooms and crowded intensive care units, where it is difficult to maintain adequate numbers of specialized staff.\"\n\nSecret Service agents, NASCAR driver and 89 fraternity students test positive\n\n\u2014U.S. Vice President Mike Pence decided to forgo his travel on Tuesday (June 30) to Arizona due to factors related to the coronavirus, according to someone familiar with the situation, The New York Times reported. The decision came after Secret Service agents who were slated to accompany Pence tested positive for COVID-19 or were showing symptoms, according to the Times. Pence was expected to headline a \"Faith in America\" campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona, followed by a tour of Yuma, the Times said. Instead, he made a shorter visit, participating in a public health briefing at an international airport in Phoenix. To date, the state has logged 91,858 cases and 1,788 related deaths, according to Worldometer. The state is one of the hot spots in the U.S. where cases have surged after early reopenings.\n\n\u2014NASCAR racer Jimmie Johnson reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 and will therefore miss Sunday's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, The Washington Post reported. He is the first NASCAR racer to test positive. Though he wasn't showing any symptoms, he got a test after his wife showed allergy-like symptoms, according to the Post. The seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion won't be able to race again until he is symptom-free, has two negative COVID-19 tests 24 hours apart and he is cleared by a doctor, the Post said.\n\n\u2014At least 89 students at the University of Washington in Seattle have tested positive for COVID-19, NBC News reported. The students are part of the school's fraternities. That number could be higher, as at least 117 students living in 15 of the school's fraternity houses have reported that they have the virus. The school is trying to verify those cases. None of the students have been hospitalized, NBC News reported. \"While we were pleased to see most of the houses had previously taken measures to reduce resident capacity by up to 50 percent this summer in response to COVID-19, those measures are not sufficient without vigilant, daily preventive measures, such as wearing face coverings, physical distancing and hand hygiene,\" said Dr. Geoffrey Gottlieb, chair of the university's Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases, NBC News reported.\n\nCould smell tests help flag early COVID-19 infections?\n\nFrom daycares to some workplaces to airports, many reopened establishments are using temperature checks to help identify those infected with COVID-19 before they spread it to others, However, as reported by Stat News, these checks are like \"trying to catch tennis balls in a soccer net: way too many can get through.\" That's because a good chunk of those with the disease show no symptoms at all. In addition, those with fevers might not have the disease at all. Some scientists are suggesting that adding a smell test to these routine screenings could help to identify \"My impression is that anosmia is an earlier symptom of Covid-19 relative to fever, and some infected people can have anosmia and nothing else,\" said Dr. Andrew Badley, head of a virus lab at the Mayo Clinic. \"So it's potentially a more sensitive screen for asymptomatic patients.\"\n\nIn a study published to the preprint server medrXiv, Badley and colleagues found that people infected with COVID-19 were 27 times more likely than non-infected individuals to have lost their sense of smell, Stat News reported. Even so, these individuals were just 2.6 times more likely than the non-infected to have a fever or chills.\n\nHere's why loss of smell may be an early sign of infection: Cells in the tissue that lines the nasal passages are covered with the receptors that the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) grabs onto in order to enter those cells. In that way, these nasal cells would be some of the first to be exposed to the virus and become infected before the virus enters the body and triggers an immune response that would cause a fever, Stat News reported.\n\n\"These support cells either secrete molecules that shut down the olfactory receptor neurons, or stop working and starve the neurons, or somehow fail to support the neurons,\" said Danielle Reed, associate director of Monell Chemical Senses Center, Stat News reported. Then, these olfactory neurons \"either stop working or die.\"\n\nStudy: Even without antibodies, you may be immune to coronavirus\n\nEven if you tested negative for antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus, there's a chance you are still immune to the virus called SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), according to a study out of Sweden. In the study, the researchers at the Karolinska Institute tested 200 people for both coronavirus antibodies and T-cells \u2014 a type of white blood cell produced by the body's immune system to fight off intruders (like SARS-CoV-2). The researchers found that for every person who tested positive for antibodies, two people tested positive for the T-cells that identify and destroy SARS-CoV-2, BBC News reported. These T-cells were found in individuals who had mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.\n\nLike antibodies, T-cells identify certain pathogens and then hold onto that memory so that when those intruders pop up again the specific T-cells can target the virus and kill it, BBC News reported. The researchers aren't sure why individuals with negative antibody tests were showing such T-cells, but they speculated that perhaps the patients had mounted an antibody response that had since faded to at least the point where the antibodies weren't detectable.\n\nThe researchers also aren't sure what kind of immunity these T-cells might provide to individuals who are not also carrying SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. It's likely that the individuals are protected from reinfection. However, the researchers noted that further studies are needed to figure out whether the T-cells provide what is called sterilizing immunity \u2014 meaning they block the virus completely so that not only is the person protected from getting sick but they also can't transmit the virus.\n\nSo what does this all mean? \"Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in,\" study researcher Marcus Buggert, assistant professor at the Center for Infectious Medicine at the Karolinska Institute, said in a statement from the institute. The study was published to the preprint server bioRxiv, meaning it has yet to be peer-reviewed by others in the field.\n\nBlack and Latino people face brunt of coronavirus, new data reveals\n\nThe racial disparities in who is taking the brunt of the novel coronavirus has become even more clear after The New York Times sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain federal data on the matter. In the most comprehensive look at nearly 1.5 million Americans infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) through the end of May, the Times found that \"Black and Latino people have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus in a widespread manner that spans the country, throughout hundreds of counties in urban, suburban and rural areas, and across all age groups,\" the Times reported. Black and Latino people in the U.S. have been three times more likely to contract the virus and nearly twice as likely to die from it compared with white people, the Times said. Those numbers came from data on 640,000 infections in nearly 1,000 U.S. counties. However, race and ethnicity information was missing from more than half of the cases; in addition, another important piece of information \u2014 how the individual contracted the virus \u2014 was also missing.\n\nExperts contacted by the Times revealed reasons why Black and Latino individuals would be more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. According to the Times, many of these individuals have frontline jobs that don't allow for work-from-home conveniences; they rely on public transportation; and they often live in tight quarters or in multigenerational homes (meaning a lot of people in a small area where social-distancing would be impossible and where one individual could spread the virus to several others).\n\n\"You literally can't isolate with one bathroom,\" said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, head of Michigan's task force on coronavirus racial disparities, the Times reported.\n\nFor instance, a 26-year-old Latino woman spoke to the Times about her experience with the coronavirus. She gave only her first name, Diana, for fear her husband might lose his job, but said that in April her husband contracted the virus at a construction site where they live in Fairfax, Virginia. Diana and her brother, also a construction worker, soon caught the virus as well. The couple and brother have three children between them, meaning six family members lived in a two-bedroom apartment.\n\n\"We have to go out to work,\" Diana told the Times. \"We have to pay our rent. We have to pay our utilities. We just have to keep working.\"\n\nRead more about the racial disparities of coronavirus infections at the Times.\n\nScientists urge WHO to acknowledge role of airborne transmission in COVID-19\n\n\u2014 More than 200 scientists are calling on the World Health Organization to better address the role of airborne transmission in the spread of the new coronavirus. In an upcoming paper in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, the scientists say there is growing evidence that the virus can spread through tiny aerosols that hang in the air, so-called \"airborne transmission, according to The Washington Post. Currently, WHO maintains that the virus spreads primarily through droplet transmission, when droplets from coughs and sneezes are expelled from people's mouths and fall quickly to the floor, and airborne transmission is only a possibility only during certain hospital procedures, according to The New York Times. The paper asks the agency to revise its recommendations in light of the evidence for airborne transmission, which would allow the virus to spread easily in crowded, poorly ventilated areas. \"We are hoping that WHO will come around and be more willing to acknowledge the important roles of aerosols,\" Donald Milton, one of the authors and a professor at the University of Maryland, told CNN.\n\n\u2014 Broadway actor Nick Cordero died on Sunday (July 5) at age 41 after being hospitalized for three months with COVID-19, according to The New York Times. Cordero reportedly had no underlying health conditions, but had experienced a number of complications from the infection, including the need for a ventilator and a medically-induced coma, and the amputation of his right leg, the Times reported. Cordero received a Tony nomination for his role in \"Bullets Over Broadway.\"\n\n\"Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone\u2019s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician,\" Cordero's wife, Amanda Kloots, wrote on Instagram. \"Elvis [Cordero and Kloots' son] and I will miss him in everything we do, everyday,\" she said.\n\nMiami rolls back openings as COVID-19 cases rise\n\n\u2014 As Florida continues to see an increase in COVID-19 cases, Miami-Dade County is rolling back some business openings. In a statement on Monday, the County's Mayor, Carlos Gimenez said that restaurants will be closed for in-person dining; and gyms and fitness centers, and short-term rentals would also need to close again. The emergency order takes effect Wednesday, July 8. \"We can tamp down the spread if everyone follows the rules, wears masks and stays at least six feet apart from others,\" Gimenez said. On the July 4 holiday, Florida set a new record for daily cases in the state when it reported more than 11,400 cases, according to The New York Times.\n\n\u2014 Harvard University has announced that up to 40% of its undergraduates, including all first-years, will be invited to live on campus during the fall semester. But in the spring, first-years would return home and seniors would be invited back to campus to complete their final semester, according to a statement from the university. All classes will be conducted online, even for students living on campus. Students will live in single bedrooms and use a shared bathroom. Students including sophomores and juniors who are not invited back to campus for the academic year will be given the opportunity to attend summer courses without tuition in 2021.\n\nAtlanta Mayor tests positive for COVID-19\n\n\u2014 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has tested positive for COVID-19, according to CNN. She broke the news in a post on Twitter, and said she has had no symptoms. Both Bottoms and her husband tested positive, but the pair has no idea how they were exposed, she said in an interview with MSNBC, according to CNN. \"It's a shock \u2026 it leaves me at a loss for words,\" she said.\n\n\u2014 The National Hockey League (NHL) announced that 35 of its players have tested positive for COVID-19 since June 8, according to The Hill. In a statement, the league said that 396 players had participated in voluntary, small-group workouts, known as Phase 2 activities, and of these, 23 had tested positive. In total, there have been more than 2,900 tests administered to the players participating in Phase 2 activities. The NHL said it is also aware of 12 additional players who have tested positive but were not involved with these practice activities. The news comes as the league announced that it will resume its season on Aug. 1 and will begin formal training camps on July 13, according to CNN.\n\nBrazilian President tests positive for COVID-19\n\n\u2014 The President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for COVID-19, according to The New York Times. Bolsonaro took a coronavirus test on Monday evening after reportedly experiencing symptoms such as a fever, the Times reported. \"Everyone knew that it would reach a considerable part of the population sooner or later. It was positive for me,\" Bolsonaro said on Brazilian TV channels on Tuesday (July 7), according to CNN. Bolsonaro has previously dismissed the threat of the new coronavirus, referring to the virus as a \"little flu,\" appearing in public without a mask and encouraging the country to reopen, according to CNN. But after his positive test, Bolsonaro appeared on TV wearing a mask and urged people not to get close to him. Bolsonaro also said that a lung screening showed his lungs are \"clean\" so far, CNN reported. Brazil has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world (with 1.6 million cases), behind only the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\u2014 After experiencing relatively few COVID-19 cases early on, the city of Melbourne, Australia has gone under lockdown again amid a spike in cases, according to The Washington Post. Residents of the city, which has a population of around 5 million people, will need to stay at home except for essential activities such as grocery shopping, exercise, medical care or work at certain businesses, and they won't be allowed to leave the city. The Australian state of Victoria, which includes Melbourne, was recently reporting just a handful of coronavirus cases each day, but over the last month cases have increased, and on Tuesday (July 7) it reported a record 191 cases, the Post reported.\n\nTrump administration announces formal withdrawal from WHO\n\n\u2014 The Trump administration has given formal notice that it will withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization, which is part of the United Nations, according to The New York Times. By law, the U.S. must give WHO a year's notice before withdrawing, and officials said the notice would take effect July 6, 2021. The U.S. is the largest funder of WHO, responsible for $426 million a year in the 2018-2019 budget period, Live Science reported. Many public health experts, as well as politicians, denounced the move. In a statement, Elizabeth Cousens, president of the United Nations Foundation (a private organization that promotes UN interests), called the move \"short-sighted, unnecessary, and unequivocally dangerous.\"\n\nCases across the U.S. continue to surge, states run out of hospital capacity, Trump pushes for school openings in the fall\n\n\u2014 There are now more than 11.8 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 544,800 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. The U.S. has nearly 3 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 131,400 deaths; Brazil has more than 1.6 million cases and 66,700 deaths; India has more than 742,400 cases and more than 20,600 deaths; Russia has more than 699,700 cases and more than 10,600 deaths; Peru has more than 309,200 cases and 10,900 deaths; and Chile has more than 301,000 cases and more than 6,400 deaths, according to the dashboard.\n\n\u2014 President Trump is pushing for schools to open in the fall, despite increasing numbers of coronavirus cases, according to CNN. \"We hope that most schools are going to be open,\" Trump said at an event at the White House, according to CNN. He claimed that places wanted to stay closed because of \"political reasons,\" according to CNN. \"We're very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools, to get them open,\" he said. Meanwhile, coronavirus cases continue to increase across the U.S. Over the last 14 days, cases have increased in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Montana, Idaho, West Virginia, Florida, Delaware, Tennessee, Nevada, Alaska, Kansas, Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi, California, New Mexico, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Texas, Ohio, Alabama, North Dakota, Oregon, Michigan, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Washington, Kentucky, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Iowa, North Carolina, Maryland and Illinois, according to data from The New York Times. Cases are not decreasing anywhere in the U.S. but case numbers remain mostly the same in Minnesota, Utah, South Dakota, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, D.C., and Guam, according to the Times.\n\n\u2014 On Tuesday, the U.S. reported more than 60,000 new cases of COVID-19, a single-day record for the country, according to CNBC. Recently, Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have been accounting for nearly half of all new U.S. daily cases, according to CNBC. Nearly 84% of Florida's intensive care unit beds are filled, according to CBS News. What's more, 25 out of Florida's 67 counties have at least one hospital with no ICU beds available, according to CBS News. Texas reported more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, a record-number of daily cases for the state, according to NPR.\n\nNYC schools will partially reopen in the fall, holding classes 3 days a week\n\n\u2014 New York City schools will partially reopen in the fall, with children attending in-person classes up to three days a week and learning remotely the rest of the week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at a press conference on Wednesday (July 8). The plan means there will likely be no more than a dozen people in classrooms at a time, down from the typical 30 students, according to The New York Times. \"Our approach for the fall maximizes in person instruction while protecting health and safety of our students and educators,\" de Blasio said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Vice President Pence said in a news briefing that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will issue new guidance for school openings next week, according to The Washington Post. The announcement came shortly after the CDC's original recommendations were criticized by President Trump. The new guidance will involve five documents that will provide \"even more clarity\" on the topic of school reopenings, Pence said. Also at the briefing, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said that \"there is a variety of unique circumstances for different schools,\" and that he and the CDC would be disappointed \"if we saw that individuals were using these guidelines as a rationale for not reopening our schools.\"\n\nNJ now requires face masks outside, President Trump's rally likely led to a spike in new coronavirus cases\n\n\u2014 New Jersey is now requiring people to wear face masks outdoors when social distancing isn\u2019t possible, according to NJ.com. Face coverings have been required indoors in New Jersey since early April but were only strongly encouraged outside, according to NJ.com. The new order requires face masks outside when social distancing isn\u2019t possible. \u201cThis is absolutely vital when individuals find themselves in a crowded situation \u2014 such as when walking down a packed boardwalk or in a line that is not properly spaced apart,\u201d Gov. Phil Murphy said yesterday at a news briefing, according to NJ.com. But there are exceptions. For example, masks aren\u2019t required if you\u2019re walking alone or with family in the neighborhood, beach or park and can stand at least 6 feet from others, he said.\n\n\u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa in late June likely led to a spike in new coronavirus cases, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said on Wednesday, according to AP News. Tulsa County confirmed 261 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, a record-high and 206 cases on Tuesday, according to AP News. The week before the rally, Tulsa County reported 76 cases on Monday and 96 cases on Tuesday, according to AP News. \u201cIn the past few days, we\u2019ve seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, so I guess we just connect the dots,\u201d Dart said, according to AP News.\n\n\u2014 The U.S. reported 62,751 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, another record, according to The Washington Post. More than 3 million people have now been infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. and more than 132,300 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard.\n\nStates that are facing surges in coronavirus cases should consider shutting down again, Fauci says\n\n\u2014 States that are facing really high numbers of coronavirus cases should consider shutting down again, Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said on Wednesday, according to The Washington Post. \u201cI think any state that is having a serious problem, that state should seriously look at shutting down,\u201d he said in a Wall Street Journal podcast, according to the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to say, because each state is different.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The pandemic is still accelerating, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization Director-General, said today, according to CNBC. \u201cThe virus can be brought under control,\u201d he said in a member states mission briefing in Geneva, according to CNBC. \u201cBut in most of the world, the virus is not under control; it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d In the last six weeks, the total number of cases across the globe has doubled, he said, according to CNBC. \u201cThe virus has upended health systems in some of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations, while some countries that have mounted a successful response have been of modest means,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\nWHO releases new guidance on airborne transmission, but it doesn't change much\n\n\u2014 There are now more than 12.2 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 555,500 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In the U.S., there are more than 3.1million cases and more than 133,200 deaths tied to the virus.\n\n\u2014 The World Health Organization (WHO) released updated coronavirus guidance on airborne transmission, but the institution's stance on the topic remains largely unchanged, according to a new Live Science report. In the new guidance, released Thursday (July 9), WHO said that airborne transmission \u2014 or spread through particles known as aerosols which hover in the air after a person has left the area \u2014 of COVID-19 in crowded, indoor locations with poor ventilation \"cannot be ruled out.\" The new guidance comes after more than 200 scientists signed a letter urging WHO to acknowledge the role of airborne transmission with COVID-19. But it's not clear that airborne transmission is playing a big role in the spread of COVID-19, according to experts contacted by Live Science.\n\nWHO says that COVID-19 is largely spread through droplet transmission, when droplets from coughs and sneezes are expelled from people's mouths and fall quickly to the floor or onto another person, according to the report. Still, WHO recommends people to \"avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation,\" and to wear fabric masks or face coverings in public places.\n\nGilead Sciences say Remdesivir reduces risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 62%. But their results aren't from a randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\n\u2014 The antiviral drug remdesivir might reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 62% compared to standard care, Gilead Sciences, the company that makes the drug, said today, according to CNBC. The analysis isn't yet published in a study and wasn't part of a randomized controlled clinical trial, but is being presented in the 23rd International AIDS (virtual) conference, according to the company. \u201cWhile not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial, this analysis importantly draws from a realworld setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data, adding to our collective understanding of this virus and reflecting the extraordinary pace of the ongoing pandemic,\u201d Dr. Susan Olender at Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in a statement, according to CNBC. The company analyzed data from 312 patients enrolled in its phase 3 clinical trial and compared the data with 818 patients in real-world settings who received standard care, according to CNBC. However, different conditions between the clinical trial group and the real world group could have altered the results, according to CNBC.\n\n\u2014 The U.S. reported more than 59,880 coronavirus cases yesterday, another daily record for the sixth time in 10 days, according to The New York Times. Alabama, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Oregon and Texas all set daily records yesterday, according to the Times. Florida with 120 new deaths and Tennessee with 22 new deaths both recorded their highest daily death toll yesterday, according to the Times.\n\nSmall study finds the cases of broken heart syndrome increased amid pandemic and an \"unknown pneumonia\" in Kazakhstan is likely undiagnosed cases of COVID-19\n\n\u2014 A Chinese embassy issued a warning about a deadly \"unknown pneumonia\" circulating in Kazakhstan, but authorities outside of China say these cases are likely undiagnosed cases of COVID-19, according to a Live Science report. The warning said that the unidentified pneumonia had killed more than 1,700 people in Kazakhstan, but authorities denied such an outbreak, according to the report. A statement from Kazakhstan's health ministry said that there were \"viral pneumonias of unspecified etiology\" in the country. However, the statement said that the classification of \"unspecified\" was used for cases of COVID-19 that had been diagnosed based on symptoms but not confirmed with lab testing, according to the report. Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that the news of this outbreak \"is certainly on our radar,\" and that the organization is working with authorities in Kazakhstan to investigate it but that the cases are likely undiagnosed COVID-19, according to the report.\n\n\u2014 Cardiologists in Ohio have found that the number of patients experiencing Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or broken heart syndrome, increased four-to-five fold during the coronavirus pandemic compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to a small new study, Live Science reported. In the new study, researchers analyzed data from 258 patients who came to the Cleveland Clinic and Cleveland Clinic Akron General with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) between March 1 and April 30, corresponding to the time period when the pandemic was first taking off in the U.S. They then compared these patients with four control groups of ACS patients who came to the clinics before the pandemic. The researchers found that 7.8% of ACS patients were diagnosed with broken heart syndrome during the pandemic, compared with 1.5% to 1.8% before the pandemic. What's more, they found that patients who had broken heart syndrome during the pandemic stayed at the hospital for longer than those in the pre-pandemic groups, according to the report. The researchers didn't find any differences in mortality rates, however. \"While the pandemic continues to evolve, self-care during this difficult time is critical to our heart health, and our overall health,\" senior author Dr. Grant Reed, director of Cleveland Clinic's ST-elevation myocardial infarction program, said in a statement. \"For those who feel overwhelmed by stress, it's important to reach out to your health care provider.\"\n\nScottish pilot leaves Vietnam hospital after given 10% odds of survival\n\nStephen Cameron, who spent more than 2 months on life support after being infected with COVID-19, has been released from Cho Ray Hospital in Vietnam, The New York Times reported. Known as Patient 91, the 43-year-old Scottish pilot traveled to Ho Chi Minh City in February to start a job at Vietnam Airlines. Then, in March he contracted the novel coronavirus after hanging out at a bar that became Vietnam's largest outbreak.\n\nFor much of his 2-plus months in a medically induced coma, Cameron's body depended on an Ecmo machine, which extracts a patient's blood, infuses it with oxygen and then pumps it back into their body, BBC News reported. Meanwhile, multiple complications from the coronavirus ensued: His blood became sticky, causing blood clots; his kidneys failed, requiring him to go on dialysis; and his lung capacity dropped to just 10%, BBC News reported.\n\nMany of his friends back home in the U.K. didn't think he would make it, and one \u2014 who was told Cameron had a 10% chance of survival \u2014 \"gave up my apartment and started doing things somebody would do if I was coming home in a box,\" Cameron said, as reported by BBC News.\n\nAfter spending 2 months in a medically induced coma, Cameron faces a long road to recovery, his doctors said.\n\n\"I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors,\" Cameron said in a video before departing on his flight home, the Times reported. \"The odds say that I shouldn't be here, and so I can only thank everybody here for doing what they have done.\"\n\nThe country itself is considered a COVID-19 success story; it's the largest country to report zero deaths from the virus and no cases of local person-to-person transmission of the virus have been reported since the middle of April, according to the Times. To date, the country of 95.5 million has reported a total of 370 COVID-19 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.\n\nCOVID-19 deaths now increasing in the US\n\nEven as COVID-19 cases began to surge in the U.S., driven by a handful of states that had reopened early, the daily deaths were flat or even decreasing. An upturn was expected, as deaths do lag behind case numbers, and it's here, according to a report by The Associated Press.\n\nAn analysis by the AP with data from the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard found that the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths reported from COVID-19 has increased from about 578 two weeks ago to 664 on July 10. While that number is still below the daily deaths being reported in the U.S. during the pandemic peak in April, the numbers look worse when state numbers are analyzed. The majority of the states where deaths have increased are averaging about 15 new deaths per day, with a small subset of states driving the death surge in the U.S.\n\nFor instance, California has averaged about 91 deaths per day and Texas with 66, the AP reported. On July 10, Florida logged 92 deaths related to COVID-19, with 120 the day before, The Washington Post reported. Arizona, another state where cases have skyrocketed, reported 75 and 44 deaths on Thursday and Friday (July 9-10), respectively, according to the Post.\n\nExperts contacted by the AP say that while they expect these deaths to continue to rise for the next few weeks, those deaths will likely not reach those seen in the spring. The AP noted several reasons for that hope: Testing is more widespread and outbreaks are better understood; lifestyles have changed, with many people wearing masks and social distancing, while doctors have a better handle on how to treat COVID-19 patients; and deadly viruses tend to wreak havoc right away on the most vulnerable populations, which have now already been hit by the virus.\n\nSunday, July 12, 9am 61 US marines in Japan test positive, causing concern on Okinawa\n\nMore than 60 U.S. marines at two bases on Okinawa Island in Japan have tested positive for COVID-19 since July 7, The Guardian reported. Thirty-eight of the cases were reported at at marine corps air station Futenma, and another 23 at Camp Hansen. Now, the governor of the island is telling the U.S. it needs to step up its disease-prevention measures.\n\n\"It is extremely regrettable that the infections are rapidly spreading among US personnel when we Okinawans are doing our utmost to contain the infections,\" Gov. Denny Tamaki said on the phone to Lt. Gen. H. Stacy Clardy, commander of III Marine Expeditionary Force, according to The Guardian. \"We now have strong doubts that the US military has taken adequate disease-prevention measures.\"\n\nAbout half of about 50,000 American troops in Japan live on Okinawa. Quarantining U.S. military members who arrive from the U.S. for staff rotations is another concern, as shortage of space on base has led to off-base hotel quarantines, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe U.S. Marines said it will now restrict off-base activities. Those who tested positive are now in isolation. To date, Okinawa has logged 152 COVID-19 cases and seven related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.\n\nRecord 15,300 new cases in Florida, Globe sees record cases, and COVID-19 cluster in Sydney\n\n\u2014Florida recorded the highest single-day tally of new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, logging 15,300 new cases, according to Worldometer, which is tracking COVID-19 stats. The state also logged 45 new deaths related to the disease. In total, Florida has confirmed 269,811 COVID-19 cases and 4,242 related deaths. This past week, the Sunshine State reported an average of 73 coronavirus fatalities a day, The Associated Press reported. That number was at 30 just three weeks ago, the AP said.\n\n\u2014The world also had a record day for new cases. Over just 24 hours, the globe reported a total of 230,370 new cases of COVID-19, a record number, according to the World Health Organization, The Guardian reported. The countries contributing the most to that number were: the U.S., Brazil, India and South Africa. On July 10, the globe reported the previous record of 228,102 new cases, according to The Guardian. Global deaths from the disease have remained relatively steady with an average of 5,000 per day. To date, the world has seen nearly 12.86 million cases and 567,957 related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins virus dashboard.\n\n\u2014A cluster of nine COVID-19 cases have been linked to a hotel in Sydney, Australia. The hotel, called Crossroads Hotel, said that anyone who had visited its pub, called Casula, between July 3 and July 10 should self-isolate, The Guardian reported. \"Part of the concern is that this hotel is used by freight drivers who are transporting essential supplies across the country. So this is a really important issue for everyone across the country,\" said Michael Kidd, the deputy chief medical officer, as reported by The Guardian. \"It is very important that anyone who was connected with that hotel does lock down.\" As of this evening, the original case of the cluster is not known, said Dr. Kerry Chant, New South Wales chief health officer, The Guardian reported.\n\nNYC reports zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic\n\n\u2014 There are now 12.9 million people who have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide and 569,697 who have died, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In the U.S., 3.3 million people have been infected and more than 135,200 have died; in Brazil, 1.8 million people have been infected and 72,100 have died; In India, 878,200 have been infected and more than 23,100 have died; in Russia, 732,547 have been infected and more than 11,400 have died; in Peru more than 326,300 have been infected and more than 11,800 have died.\n\n\u2014 On July 11, New York City reported zero coronavirus deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, according to NBC News. New York City hasn't had a single day without a death related to the virus since March 13, according to NBC News.\n\n\u2014 The right kind of UV light, at the right kind of dosage, can kill SARS-COV-2, according to a Live Science report. But many at-home UV lights claiming to kill the new coronavirus likely won't work, according to the report. UV radiation can be classified into three types based on wavelength: UVA, UVB and UVC. The latter, with the shortest wavelength and highest energy, can act as a disinfectant, according to the report. UVC has been used for years and has proven effective in inactivating H1N1 influenza and other coronaviruses, according to the report. That being said, UVC can damage DNA which makes it very dangerous to human skin and eyes, Indermeet Kohli, a physicist who studies photomedicine in dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, told Live Science, according to the report. So UVC technology should primarily be operated by medical facilities and should be evaluated for safety and efficacy, she said.\n\nAmid a continuing rise in coronavirus cases, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered many indoor operations to close\n\n\u2014 Amid a continuing rise in coronavirus cases, California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered indoor operations to close in restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, family entertainment, zoos, museums, and cardrooms, according to a tweet from Newsom. He ordered bars to close all operations. \u201cThe data suggests not everyone is acting with common sense,\u201d Newsom said at a press conference Monday, according to CNBC. The state reported more than 8,300 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, according to CNBC. This order is one of the largest rollbacks since states began to reopen, according to CNBC. San Diego Unified and Los Angeles Unified School Districts \u2014 California's two largest school districts \u2014 announced today that the new school year will start online, according to a statement.\n\n\u2014 An estimated 5.4 million people in the U.S. lost their health insurance between February and May during the coronavirus pandemic, according to The New York Times. A new study by the advocacy group Families U.S.A found that increase in uninsured laid-off workers over this period was almost 40 percent higher than the increase during the 2008-2009 recession, the Times reported. In Texas alone, the number of people uninsured leaped from 4.2 million to nearly 4.9 million, according to the Times. In the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (37 states), 23% of laid off workers became uninsured; in the states that didn't (13 states), 43% of laid-off workers became uninsured, the Times reported.\n\n43 new coronavirus cases linked to single house party in Michigan; cases across the country continue to surge\n\n\u2014 In Michigan, 43 new coronavirus cases have been linked to a single house party, according to CNN. Health officials are asking anyone who attended the party, which took place between July 2 and July 3 to self-quarantine and monitor symptoms for 14 days, according to CNN. Most of the new cases were among young people between the ages of 15 and 25, according to a statement from Washtenaw County in Michigan. The health department also identified 66 exposed close contacts \u2014 or anyone who had face-to-face contact with a positive case for 15 minutes or more, not including family members in the same household, according to the statement. \"This is a very clear example of how quickly this virus spreads and how many people can be impacted in a very short amount of time,\" Jimena Loveluck, a Health Officer at the Washtenaw County Health Department said in the statement. \"We cannot hope to accomplish our goal of containing COVID-19 and preventing additional cases, hospitalizations and deaths without full community support and cooperation.\"\n\n\"We need people of all ages, including young people, to take COVID-19 seriously and follow public health guidelines and instructions. That means avoiding large gatherings without physical distancing or face coverings. It also means cooperating with the Health Department to complete case investigation and contact tracing,\" Loveluck said.\n\n\u2014 There are now more than 3.3 million people who have been infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. and more than 135,600 who have died from the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. Cases continue to increase across the U.S. \"Miami is now the epicenter of the pandemic,\" Lilian Abbo with the Jackson Health System said during a press conference, CNN reported. There are more than 2,000 patients hospitalized and hundreds in the intensive care units in Miami, according to CNN. \u201cWhat we were seeing in Wuhan \u2014 six months ago, five months ago \u2014 now we are there,\" Abbo said. Meanwhile, Texas hospitals are running out of beds, ventilators, drugs and staff, according to The Texas Tribune. \"It\u2019s going to be a rough few weeks,\" John Henderson, president of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals told the Tribune. \"Most everything we\u2019re seeing is worrisome or scary.\" Texas has now reported more than 264,300 cases of COVID-19 and more than 3,200 deaths, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services dashboard. Arizona ICU\u2019s are nearly fully and the state has reported more than 2,500 new coronavirus cases on Sunday and over the past week, nearly 27% of tests in the state came back positive \u2014 the highest rate in the country, according to CBS News. \"We have for the last three weeks been the worst in the entire country,\" Will Humble, the executive director of the Arizona Public Health Association and former director of the Arizona Department of Health Services told CBS News. \"People sacrificed so much during the stay-at-home order with their jobs, and then when it wasn't phased, as we transitioned into a post-stay-at-home, we'd lost that progress.\"\n\nFlorida and Alabama see record number of coronavirus-related deaths, the Tri-state area adds four states to its quarantine list\n\n\u2014 Florida reported 132 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday, a record-number for the state, according to The New York Times. Alabama also set a record on Tuesday with 40 deaths, according to the Times. As of Monday, the U.S. is recording, on average, 724 deaths a day, whereas as the month began, the U.S. was averaging below 500, according to the Times.\n\n\u2014 New Jersey, Connecticut and New York added four new states to its coronavirus quarantine travel advisory and removed Delaware from its advisory, according to NJ.com. People coming from the now 22 hotspot states that make up this list, are being asked to quarantine upon arrival to the Tri-state, according to NBC New York. States on the quarantine list are now: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, New Mexico, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio.\n\n\u2014 Philadelphia is now prohibiting any large public event on public property, through February 28 of 2021, according to 6ABC. Mayor Jim Kenney's new order applies to special events and gatherings of 50 people or more on public property, according to 6ABC. Under this order, festivals, parades, concerts, carnivals, fairs and flea markets are prohibited as are residential block parties until further notice, Kenney announced today. This order, however, doesn't apply to demonstrations and first amendment-related activities, private events that are not advertised like family gatherings or weddings, recreational activities with fewer than 25 people and events taking place on private property such as performance venues, according to 6ABC.\n\nCDC says wearing face masks is a 'civic duty'\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is calling on all Americans to wear face masks in public settings. The agency has recommended masks for months, but in an editorial published Tuesday (July 14) in the journal JAMA, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and colleagues cited new evidence that face coverings help prevent the spread of COVID-19. The authors pointed to a new report on cases of COVID-19 at a hair salon in Missouri, which showed that two infected hair stylists did not spread the disease to any of their 139 clients when the stylists and customers wore masks. The editorial also cited the case of a hospital system in Boston, which reduced COVID-19 transmission after a universal mask policy. \"At this critical juncture when COVID-19 is resurging, broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty, a small sacrifice reliant on a highly effective low-tech solution that can help turn the tide favorably in national and global efforts against COVID-19,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe United States reported a record 67,417 new coronavirus cases yesterday\n\n\u2014 The United States reported 67,417 new coronavirus cases yesterday, a new daily record for the country, according to CNBC. Daily cases in the U.S. have been averaging about 62,210 over the past week, which is up more than 21% from last week's average and more than three times the average from a month ago, according to CNBC. Texas, California and Florida made up nearly half of those new cases reported yesterday.\n\n\u2014 More than 30 COVID-19 candidate vaccines are being tested in clinical trials, according to a Live Science report. But given that most vaccines take years to develop, how will we know when the first coronavirus vaccine that's approved will be safe and effective? Experts told Live Science that all candidate COVID-19 vaccines must pass through the same clinical trial phases as any other vaccine, before earning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Provided that the trials include thousands of participants and thorough protocols to track side effects, the public can be confident that the approved vaccines are safe, they said, according to Live Science.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is now telling hospitals to send COVID-19 data to the agency, rather than to the CDC\n\n\u2014 There have now been more than 13.4 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide and more than 580,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In Brazil there have been more than 1.9 million cases and more than 74,100 deaths; In India there have been more than 936,100 cases and more than 24,300 deaths; in Russia there have been more than 745,100 cases and more than 11,700 deaths; in Peru there have been more than 333,800 cases and more than 12,200 deaths, according to the dashboard.\n\n\u2014 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is no longer in charge of compiling COVID-19 data, according to a new Live Science report. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is now telling hospitals to send COVID-19 data to the agency, rather than to the CDC, which used to compile and share the data on publicly accessible databases, according to the report. The orders, posted to the HHS website, direct hospitals to send daily reports to the HHS about their total number of COVID-19 patients, admissions and related deaths from the previous day, their ICU bed occupancy, ventilators in use, staffing shortages and supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), among other information, according to the report. But some health experts are voicing concerns about how this decision may limit the amount of data available to the public, scientists and health officials as the pandemic continues to rage across the country, according to the report.\n\n\u2014 Moderna's experimental COVID-19 vaccine, called mRNA-1273, showed promising early results in 45 participants, according to data published in The New England Journal of Medicine. All of the participants in the trial, after receiving two doses of the vaccine, developed neutralizing antibodies \u2014 proteins that can block the new coronavirus from infecting cells, according to a Live Science report. These findings back up the results that Moderna released in May that hadn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, according to the report. The vaccine appeared safe and generally well-tolerated by participants, although more than half of participants experienced some side effects which can also occur with the annual flu shot, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle aches and pain at the injection site, according to the report. Some participants in the middle and high dose groups experienced a fever after the second injection, according to the report. The company has already started a Phase 2 trial and plans to start a larger Phase 3 trial in late July, according to the report.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order that bans cities from requiring masks, as the state records its second-highest number of daily coronavirus cases\n\n\u2014 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order that bans cities from requiring masks, according to The Washington Post. Kemp\u2019s order, which nullifies already existing mask mandates in more than a dozen cities or counties, came as Georgia recorded 3,871 new coronavirus cases yesterday, the second-highest the state has seen since the start of the pandemic, the Post reported. \u201cIt is officially official. Governor Kemp does not give a damn about us,\u201d Savannah Mayor Van Johnson wrote on Twitter, the Post reported. \u201cEvery man and woman for himself/herself. Ignore the science and survive the best you can. In #Savannah, we will continue to keep the faith and follow the science. Masks will continue to be available!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Amid an uptick in cases , France will start requiring masks in all public indoor spaces starting next week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said today, according to The New York Times. Masks were already required on public transport in the country. Britain also announced this week that face coverings will be required in shops and supermarkets beginning at the end of next week, according to the Times.\n\n\u2014 India recorded 32,695 new cases of the coronaviru on Thursday, the highest number of daily cases the country has seen since the start of the pandemic, according to NPR. The country now has more than 968,800 cases of COVID-19 (third most number of cases around the world, after Brazil and the U.S.) and more than 24,900 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard. In late March, India had put in place one of the first lockdowns in the world (and one of the strictest), but eased those restrictions in early June because of the damage it caused to the economy, according to NPR.\n\nResearchers plan to recruit healthy volunteers for a challenge study to test experimental Oxford vaccine\n\n\u2014 Researchers at Oxford University's Jenner Institute who are developing a candidate COVID-19 vaccine are hoping to start challenge studies on volunteers within months, according to The Guardian. These controversial challenge studies would deliberately expose healthy volunteers to the coronavirus after they have been given the experimental vaccine, according to a previous Live Science report. This would allow the trial to be completed within a couple of weeks with far fewer people than required in clinical trials in which people are given the vaccine and then monitored to see if it works in protecting people who naturally become exposed to the coronavirus, according to The Guardian. The Oxford vaccine has completed a phase 1 clinical trial with 1,000 British volunteers and tens of thousands of people globally are also being recruited for a phase 3 trial, according to The Guardian.\n\nBut the researchers are hoping to also complete the challenge study in parallel with the phase 3 trial or after the phase 3 trial is completed, accord", "url": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/coronavirus-outbreak-live-updates/ar-BB179PIG", "school_rgx": 28, "adminX": "Idaho", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Idaho\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "COVID Is Spreading Much Faster Now Than It Was in the Spring, Study Finds", "publish_date": null, "text": "\u00a9 Provided by Best Life\n\nBy now, the daily COVID-19 figures coming out of states like Arizona, Florida, Texas, and California are a grim reminder of just how quickly the virus has spread across the U.S. And while these hotspots have seen the most startling numbers, they are far from alone in watching the virus's pace quicken. Recent data shows that COVID-19 is spreading faster than it was in the spring in almost half of all U.S. states, according to a USA Today study.\n\nIdaho, for example, originally saw low to stable increases in cases just months ago. In early April, the Gem State was reporting roughly five new cases per hour, before dropping to less than one per hour by mid-May, USA Today reports. But recent figures have shown that cases are now four-fold what they were before reopening in May, with about 20 new coronavirus cases cropping up per hour.\n\nIn addition to Idaho, other states and territories where cases are increasing faster than they were in the spring include Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Best Life map of idaho showing covid outbreak\n\nThe doubling of case rates in a short period of time is becoming more troublingly common for many states in the Sun Belt region of the U.S.\n\nBut recent figures also show that COVID-19 is even spreading faster in states that were believed to have successfully beat the virus. Rhode Island, for example, had earned praise for its seemingly effective handling of the pandemic, but the state saw a 109 percent increase in new cases last week.\n\nRELATED: For more up-to-date information, sign up for our daily newsletter.\n\nFortunately, it's not all bad news. Outside of Rhode Island, the rest of the Northeast is one region of the U.S. which is showing signs of improvement, with case levels in states such as New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey far below what they saw in the spring, USA Today reports.

{"title": "AP FACT CHECK: Trump's alternate reality on COVID-19 threat", "publish_date": "07-20-2020 00:00", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump appears to be living in an alternate reality when it comes to the COVID-19 threat.\n\nOver the weekend, he clung to the misguided notion that the virus will just \u201cdisappear\u201d even as his top science experts and GOP allies bluntly say otherwise.\n\nTrump also continued to wrongly insist that anyone who wants a coronavirus test is getting one, made the head-scratching suggestion that the virus is under control when infections are surging to fresh daily highs and lodged false accusations against the nation\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nThe statements came in a week of distorted truth. Trump referred repeatedly to his \u201cban\u201d on travel from China that wasn\u2019t so and issued a scattered indictment of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden.\n\nA look at his rhetoric and how they compare with the facts:\n\nTRUMP vs. FAUCI\n\nTRUMP: \u201cDr. Fauci at the beginning said, \u2018This will pass. Don\u2019t worry about it. This will pass.\u2019 He was wrong.\u201d - interview aired on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is overstating it. While Fauci said in January and February that Americans need not panic about a virus threat at the time, he also said the situation was \u201cevolving\u201d and that public health officials were taking the threat seriously.\n\n\u201cRight now the risk is still low, but this could change, I\u2019ve said that many times,\u201d Fauci told NBC on Feb. 29. He allowed that if there are growing cases of community spread, it could become a \u201cmajor outbreak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nFauci never claimed the virus would just \u201cpass\u201d or disappear.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cDr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s incorrect. While Fauci expressed some initial reservations about travel restrictions on China, he supported the decision by the time it was made.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who was coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force at the time and announced the travel restrictions, said Trump made the decision in late January after accepting the \u201cuniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS.\u201d\n\nWhile the World Health Organization did advise against the overuse of travel restrictions, Azar told reporters in February that his department\u2019s career health officials had made a \u201cconsidered recommendation, which I and the president adopted\u201d in a bid to slow spread of the virus.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI will be right eventually. You know I said, \u2018It\u2019s going to disappear.\u2019 I\u2019ll say it again. It\u2019s going to disappear, and I\u2019ll be right.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019ll put out the flames. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be under control.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: \u201cThe virus is not going to disappear,\u201d according to Fauci.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases in the U.S. per day has risen over the past month, hitting over 70,000 this past week, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. That is higher even than what the country experienced from mid-April through early May, when deaths sharply rose.\n\nFauci has warned that the increase across the South and West \u201cputs the entire country at risk\u201d and that new infections could reach 100,000 a day if people don\u2019t start listening to guidance from public health authorities to wear a mask and practice social distancing.\n\nArizona, California, Florida and Texas have recently been forced to shut down bars and businesses as virus cases surge. The U.S. currently has more than 3.7 million known cases and many more undetected.\n\nIn February, Trump asserted coronavirus cases were going \u201cvery substantially down, not up,\u201d and told Fox Business it will be fine because \u201cin April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, visiting a hospital Wednesday in Kentucky, acknowledged that some of those early predictions were too rosy. \u201cThe straight talk here that everyone needs to understand: This is not going away,\u201d he said.\n\nFauci says there \u201ccertainly\u201d will be coronavirus infections in the fall and winter.\n\n___\n\nPETER NAVARRO, White House trade adviser: \u201cWhen Fauci was telling the White House Coronavirus Task Force that there was only anecdotal evidence in support of hydroxychloroquine to fight the virus, I confronted him with scientific studies providing evidence of safety and efficacy. A recent Detroit hospital study showed a 50% reduction in the mortality rate when the medicine is used in early treatment.\u201d - op-ed published Wednesday in USA Today.\n\nTHE FACTS: Navarro cherry-picks a study widely criticized as flawed and ignores multiple studies finding hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t help.\n\nNumerous rigorous tests of hydroxychloroquine, including a large one from Britain and one led by the National Institutes of Health, concluded that the anti-malaria drug was ineffective for treating hospitalized coronavirus patients. Fauci leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration also has warned the drug should only be used for the coronavirus in hospitals and research settings because of the risk of serious heart rhythm problems and other safety issues.\n\nThe Henry Ford Health System study that Navarro refers to was an observational look back at how various patients fared. It was not a rigorous test where similar patients are randomly assigned to get the drug or not and where each group is compared later on how they did.\n\nIn the study, some people with heart or certain other conditions were not given the drugs, which can cause heart rhythm problems, so those patients were fundamentally different from the group they were compared with. Researchers said they adjusted statistically for some differences, but the many variables make it tough to reach firm conclusions.\n\nSome patients also received other treatments such as steroids and the antiviral drug remdesivir, further clouding any ability to tell whether hydroxychloroquine helped.\n\nThe White House said Navarro was not authorized to challenge Fauci with the op-ed and should not have done it. But his points largely reflect ones Trump and others in the White House have made themselves.\n\n___\n\nMORE ON VIRUS THREAT\n\nTRUMP, on what happened after he restricted travel from China: \u201cNancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later, and even later than that, and others, too.\u201d - Rose Garden remarks Tuesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: No she wasn\u2019t. This is Trump\u2019s frequent and fanciful account of the House speaker\u2019s visit to San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown on Feb. 24. That day, she visited shops and strolled the streets to counter the hostility some people in the district were encountering over a virus that emanated from China.\n\nOn that day, Pelosi said the public should be vigilant about the virus but the city took precautions and \u201cwe should come to Chinatown.\u201d Local TV news tracked her visit;. She wasn\u2019t seen dancing and did not call for a \u201cstreet fair,\u201d as Trump at times has put it. Community spread of the coronavirus had not yet been reported.\n\nAs FactCheck.org pointed out, the same day Pelosi went to Chinatown, Trump tweeted: \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health (Organization) have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d The CDC is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTwo days later, Trump asserted that only 15 people in the U.S. were infected and that number would go down \u201cclose to zero.\u201d Instead the numbers exploded. More than 3.6 million Americans have had COVID-19.\n\nTrump has accused Pelosi of being \u201cresponsible for many deaths\u201d because of the Chinatown visit. He has denied responsibility for any of the deaths sweeping the country as he has persistently minimized the threat, pushed for reopening and refused to take mask-wearing seriously.\n\n___\n\nTESTING\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s repeating the false notion that anybody who wants a COVID-19 test can get one.\n\nAmericans are being confronted with long lines at testing sites. People often are disqualified if they are not showing symptoms and, if they are tested, they sometimes are forced to wait many days for results.\n\nJulie Khani, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics and other labs, has made clear that \u201cthe anticipated demand for COVID-19 testing over the coming weeks will likely exceed members\u2019 testing capacities.\u201d This past week the group encouraged members to give priority to \u201cthose most in need, especially hospitalized and symptomatic patients.\u201d\n\nMany governors and local officials say they cannot meet the demand.\n\n\u201cTesting has been a challenge everywhere,\u201d says Utah Republican Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nAround Seattle, for instance, a new wave of patients is showing up at emergency departments, said nurse Mike Hastings.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really frustrating from my side of it is when a patient comes into the emergency department, and is not really having symptoms of COVID, but they feel like they need that testing,\u201d said Hastings, who is president of the Emergency Nurses Association. \u201cSometimes we\u2019re not able to test them because we don\u2019t have enough test supplies, so we\u2019re only testing a certain set of patients.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cCases are up, because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s not true that infections are high only because the U.S. diagnostic testing has increased. Trump\u2019s own top public health officials have shot down this line of thinking. Infections are rising because people are infecting each other more than they were when most everyone was hunkered down.\n\nIncreased testing does contribute to the higher numbers, but there\u2019s more to it. Testing in fact has uncovered a worrisome trend: The percentage of tests coming back positive for the virus is on the rise across nearly the entire country.\n\nThat\u2019s a clear demonstration that sickness is spreading and that the U.S. testing system is falling short.\n\n\u201cA high rate of positive tests indicates a government is only testing the sickest patients who seek out medical attention and is not casting a wide enough net,\u201d says the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, a primary source of updated information on the pandemic.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cNo country has ever done what we\u2019ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody\u2019s done is our job on testing, because we\u2019re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries; they don\u2019t even do tests. \u2026 They don\u2019t go around have massive areas of testing, and we do.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: U.S. testing is not the envy of the world, nor is the U.S. the only country that does mass testing.\n\nU.S. testing on a per capita basis lags other countries that have done a far better job of controlling their outbreaks. State, local and federal officials are warning of the consequences of testing bottlenecks, including tests rendered useless because results come too late.\n\nChina has used batch testing, mixing samples and testing them together, as part of a recent campaign to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan. It\u2019s an approach that top U.S. health officials believe could be used to boost U.S. screening, though it\u2019s not clear when pooled testing could become available for wide-scale screenings at U.S. schools and businesses.\n\n\u201cWe are nowhere near being able to rein in this virus with the amount of testing we have available at the moment,\u201d said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore\u2019s health commissioner.\n\nDr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said test results in parts of the U.S. take as long as a week, which is \u201ctoo long.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do the testing to find out who\u2019s carrying the virus and then quickly get them isolated so they don\u2019t spread it around,\u201d he said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s very hard to make that work when there\u2019s a long delay built in.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDEATH RATES\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: \u201cThat\u2019s not true, sir.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: \u201cNumber one, low mortality rate.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump\u2019s claim is wholly unsupported.\n\nAn accurate death rate is impossible to know. Every country tests and counts people differently, and some are unreliable in reporting cases. Without knowing the true number of people who become infected, it cannot be determined what portion of them die.\n\nUsing a count kept by Johns Hopkins University, you can compare the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases. That count shows the U.S. experiencing more deaths as a percentage of cases than most other countries now being hit hard with the pandemic. The statistics look better for the U.S. when the list is expanded to include European countries that were slammed early on by the virus but now appear to have it under control. Even then, the U.S. is not shown to be among the best in avoiding death.\n\nSuch calculations, though, do not provide a reliable measurement of actual death rates because of the variations in testing and reporting, and the Johns Hopkins tally is not meant to be such a measure.\n\nThe only way to tell how many cases have gone uncounted, and therefore what percentage of infected people have died from the disease, is to do another kind of test comprehensively, of people\u2019s blood, to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus. Globally, that is only being done in select places.\n\n___\n\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIf you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: U.S. health officials actually believe Trump was late in restricting travel from parts of Europe.\n\nWhile Trump imposed travel restrictions on China in late January, he didn\u2019t follow up with many European countries until mid-March. Those delayed travel alerts as well as limited testing contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, according to Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cWe clearly didn\u2019t recognize the full importations that were happening,\u201d Schuchat told The Associated Press in May.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe would\u2019ve had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China. But we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. \u2026 By closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives.\u201d - Rose Garden remarks\n\nTHE FACTS: He didn\u2019t ban travel from China. He restricted it. Dozens of countries took similar steps to control travel from hot spots before or around the same time the U.S. did.\n\nThe U.S. restrictions that took effect Feb. 2 continued to allow travel to the U.S. from China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao territories over the past five months. The Associated Press reported that more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign nationals based in those territories entered the U.S. in the first three months after the travel restrictions were imposed.\n\nAdditionally, more than 27,000 Americans returned from mainland China in the first month after the restrictions took effect. U.S. officials lost track of more than 1,600 of them who were supposed to be monitored for virus exposure.\n\nFew doubt that the heavy death toll from COVID-19 would be even heavier if world travel had not been constricted globally. But Trump has no scientific basis to claim that his action alone saved \u201cmillions\u201d or even \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of lives, as he has put it.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on Biden: \u201cHe opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. \u2018Xenophobic,\u2019 he called me. \u2018Xenophobic.\u2019 A month later, he admitted I was right.\u201d - Rose Garden.\n\nTHE FACTS: No, Biden did not come out against the travel restrictions on China. He said little about them at the time. In April, his campaign said he supported travel restrictions if \u201cguided by medical experts.\u201d\n\nBiden did say Trump has a record of xenophobia, a comment made during an Iowa campaign event when the restrictions were announced. Biden said Trump was \u201cfear-mongering\u201d against foreigners and the Democrat took issue with Trump\u2019s references to the \u201cChina virus\u201d as an example. He did not address the travel steps.\n\nTrump has claimed that Biden realized he was right after all about restricting travel from China and wrote him a \u201cletter of apology.\u201d This didn\u2019t happen, either.\n\n___\n\nPOLICE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cBiden wants to defund the police.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: To be clear, Biden has not joined the call of protesters who demanded \u201cdefund the police\u201d after George Floyd\u2019s killing in Minneapolis. He\u2019s proposed more money for police, conditioned to improvements in their practices.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support defunding the police,\u201c Biden said last month in a CBS interview. But he said he would support tying federal aid to police based on whether \u201cthey meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s criminal justice agenda, released long before he became the Democrats\u2019 presumptive presidential nominee, proposes more federal money for \u201ctraining that is needed to avert tragic, unjustifiable deaths\u201d and hiring more officers to ensure that departments are racially and ethnically reflective of the populations they serve.\n\nSpecifically, he calls for a $300 million infusion into existing federal community policing grant programs.\n\nThat adds up to more money for police, not defunding law enforcement.\n\nBiden also wants the federal government to spend more on education, social services and struggling areas of cities and rural America, to address root causes of crime.\n\n___\n\nECONOMY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world; not only of this country, anywhere in the world, until we got hit with the China virus.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: Not true. The economy was healthy back then but not the best in U.S. history, much less world history.\n\nEconomic gains largely followed along the lines of an expansion that started more than a decade ago under President Barack Obama. And while posting great job and stock market numbers, Trump never managed to achieve the rates of economic growth he promised in the 2016 campaign. The U.S. economy was not the world\u2019s best in history when this started.\n\n___\n\nMILITARY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military.\u201d - Fox interview.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump often boasts about the size of the military pay raises under his administration, but there\u2019s nothing extraordinary about them.\n\nSeveral raises in the past decade have been larger than service members are getting under Trump - 3.1% this year, 2.6% last year, 2.4% in 2018 and 2.1% in 2017.\n\nRaises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, for example, were all 3.4% or more.\n\nPay increases shrank after that because of congressionally mandated budget caps. Trump and Congress did break a trend that began in 2011 of pay raises that hovered between 1% and 2%.\n\n___\n\nAP Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee and Associated Press writer Will Weissert in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE - A look at the veracity of claims by political figures.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apnews.com/APFactCheck\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/20/ap-fact-check-trumps-alternate-reality-on-covid-19/", "school_rgx": 3, "adminX": "Idaho", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Idaho\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

The group protesting against face masks being required in schools removed the social distancing tape on the chairs and filled the Utah County Commission room to over flowing, prompting Commissioner Tanner Ainge to call for a vote to adjourn the meeting. (Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 People crowding into a public meeting in Utah to push for an exception to mask requirements in schools was \u201cfoolish\u201d and suggested an \u201calmost mob mentality\u201d on the issue, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday.\n\nHerbert spoke the day after local officials in Utah County abruptly canceled the meeting because the crowd did not follow social-distancing guidelines meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Utah, like many states, has been experiencing a surge of coronavirus cases in recent months.\n\nThe three-member county commissioners had planned to vote on whether to ask for a partial exemption from Herbert\u2019s statewide mask mandate for schools. Attendees at the board meeting in Provo booed after the commissioners opted to push the vote to a later date because of health concerns.\n\nVideo footage showed the meeting was packed with people who opposed the mandate, few of whom were wearing masks.\n\n\u201cI think the experts will tell us that\u2019s kind of a foolish action,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cPeople get caught up in almost a mob mentality \u2026 there\u2019s a better way to dialog with leadership.\u201d\n\nHealth experts say masks can prevent the spread of the disease by catching respiratory droplets that contain the virus when people exhale or cough.

{"title": "The 2020 Tokyo Summer Games were supposed to start this weekend. Here\u2019s what was lost, and what might be next.", "publish_date": "07-23-2020 00:00", "text": "The building wraps were nothing but window dressing, really.\n\nLiterally as tall as a skyscraper and as big as an office building, they could swathe downtown\u2019s most monolithic edifices with the likenesses of some of the USA\u2019s most recognizable winter athletes. Yet when it came to hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, they were just nice, not necessary. So it wasn\u2019t until carefully scrutinizing the budget five months before the opening ceremonies \u2014 barely enough time to get the wraps printed and mounted before the world turned its attention to Utah \u2014 that the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee decided it could afford to commission 14 of them.\n\nTwo weeks later, on Sept. 11, 2001, the world was set on fire.\n\nSuddenly, the idea of holding a massive, global sporting event in the United States appeared less than prudent. Other countries started suggesting they might sit this one out. And then there was the relatively minor yet still looming question of what to do with those building wraps? They couldn\u2019t be returned and there was no place to store 500,000 square feet of mesh, perforated window film and vinyl banners if organizers postponed or canceled the Games.\n\nThat\u2019s Tokyo\u2019s situation today \u2014 times 1,000. Friday marks the day the 2020 Summer Games were scheduled to open in Japan\u2019s capital city, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced their postponement until 2021, with the hope that by then the virus that has killed more than 615,000 worldwide will be under control. But rescheduling the dates isn\u2019t as simple as just looking at a calendar. It\u2019s more akin to turning back time, with equally messy repercussions.\n\n\u201cI think what Tokyo is facing is probably the most difficult thing any Olympic Games can face because all of their commitments are time-bound,\u201d said Fraser Bullock, the COO and CFO of the organizing committee for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. \u201cSo all of these time-bound commitments now have to be unwound. And that\u2019s very expensive.\u201d\n\nHow expensive? Cost-of-postponement estimates range from an additional $2.7 billion to $5.7 billion. That\u2019s for an Olympic Games that has already officially overshot its 2013 bid estimate of $7.3 billion by more than $5 billion. Combined, those costs could put Tokyo 2020 alongside London 2012 as the most expensive Summer Games in history, according to a 2016 Oxford study.\n\nHow can the delay cost nearly half as much as hosting the Olympics? Consider it the cost of turning back the clock.\n\nPostponement problems\n\nMost Olympic hosts, but not all \u2014 we\u2019re looking at you, Rio de Janeiro, Sochi and Athens \u2014 build venues and invest in infrastructural improvements with the expectation that they will benefit the region for years to come. For Tokyo, that meant the construction of eight new permanent venues, the last of which was completed in February, and 10 temporary venues as well as the refurbishment of 25 existing facilities.\n\nNearly all of those, except the temporary structures, were scheduled to begin use by other entities within months after the closing ceremony for the Paralympic Games in mid-August. Now Games organizers must decide whether to allow those events to go on, making the venues less pristine come 2021, or to find other homes for them. Regardless, they will have to relocate events scheduled in those facilities between July 23-Sept. 5, 2021, the new dates for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. And each relocation will no doubt require some form of compensation.\n\nThe temporary structures may actually pose more of a conundrum. They were only supposed to last a little more than a month, not an entire year, but the cost of taking them down and putting them up again would likely be more than maintaining them over the next 12 months. The same goes for the tent cities that encircle most venues and were meant to serve as media workrooms, conference rooms, security and medical stations and the like.\n\nBullock called those \u201coverlays\u201d and said they ate up a massive chunk of the budget for Salt Lake City\u2019s Olympics.\n\n\u201cWe built these small cities, and the budget at that point in time was over $100 million,\u201d of a $1.9-$2.5 billion budget, he said. \u201cSo this is a very significant effort.\u201d\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Contracts signed almost a decade ago, even before organizers submitted their bid to the International Olympic Committee in 2013, must be renegotiated. That includes contracts for approximately 14,000 hotel rooms as well as buses and transportation equipment, grandstands and other seats, tables, generators, warehouses and concessions.\n\nIt also includes people. Full-time staff hired for the Games have to be paid for an extra year or let go and then re-trained. Tokyo\u2019s 80,000 volunteers also will have to be retrained and their numbers may have to be expanded to accommodate coronavirus safety protocols.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news for Tokyo, though. Take the athletes\u2019 village for example. While more than a quarter of the newly built luxury apartments that make up the village have already been sold, ESPN reported that residents aren\u2019t supposed to start moving in until 2023. So, organizers caught a small break there.\n\nInsurance may also help cover costs stemming from the delay in some circumstances (though in Salt Lake\u2019s case, it would only have kicked in if the Games were canceled). Plus, if organizers can pull off the 2021 event the way they have marketed it, as a global celebration of the world moving past the COVID-19 pandemic, then they also stand to bring in a record amount of sponsorship money.\n\n\u201cWe can, together with the organizing committee, turn these postponed Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 into an unprecedented celebration of unity and solidarity of humankind,\u201d IOC president Thomas Bach said in a speech last week, \u201cmaking them a symbol of resilience and hope.\u201d\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, that\u2019s mostly happy talk. When or, rather, if the last firework erupts at the closing ceremony, the Japanese taxpayers will still be on the hook for billions of dollars.\n\nUncertain future\n\nBullock\u2019s experience overseeing the 2002 Games gives him unique insight into the headache-inducing issues organizers of the Tokyo Game are wrestling with right now. He remembers how everything paused \u2014 ticket sales, sponsor interest, the construction of tent cities around each venue \u2014 in the weeks after the twin towers of the World Trade Center fell.\n\nWithin a few months, though, balance had been restored. The event\u2019s rapid rebound was a tribute to the organizing committee\u2019s thorough planning, which included preparing contingency plans for about 800 different unforeseen disruptions, among which was a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cIf you have a grade-based plan, then contingency planning builds on that and your team gets to the point where they say, \u2018We\u2019re ready for anything,\u2019\u201d Bullock said. \u201cThey really have their confidence.\u201d\n\nYet while they share some similarities, the threat of a terrorist attack and the threat of a deadly virus are obviously different animals. Working with the Secret Service, Salt Lake City\u2019s group beefed up security. Those efforts helped countries with reservations about attending the Games ultimately decide to send their athletes.\n\nBut even the Secret Service can\u2019t stop the coronavirus.\n\nFor that reason, even with an extra year\u2019s grace, nothing about the Tokyo Games is certain. Will fans be able to attend? Will athletes, coaches, media and personnel from the 206 National Olympic Committees worldwide have to quarantine for two weeks before entering the country? If they do, will the Games be held in a bubble, similar to the one established by the NBA in Florida, with strict penalties for those who leave it? Can the Games even be held?\n\nBach said last week that an Olympics with no fans is a last resort. Still, it\u2019s preferable to further postponing the Tokyo Games, which he said is not an option. Games or not, after next summer the IOC\u2019s attention will turn to the Winter Games in Beijing in 2022 and the Summer Games in Paris in 2024.\n\nBut if the Tokyo Games fall, so might the Beijing Games, scheduled for six months later. Richard Pound, one of the longest sitting IOC members, said during an interview with Reuters last week that the threat of losing both events to the virus is real, especially if no vaccine exists.\n\n\u201cTaking the political side out of it for the moment, say there is a COVID problem in July and August next year in Tokyo,\u201d Pound said. \u201cIt is hard to imagine there is not going to be a knock-on effect in the same area five months later.\u201d\n\nBullock called Pound \u201cvery candid and very observant,\u201d but disagreed with his assessment. He said a postponement of those Games would be more likely.\n\nThe postponement of a Games has no effect on the Olympic schedule or the dates or sites of future winter or summer events, such as Milano Cortina 2026 or Los Angeles 2028. Once the viable window for an Olympics passes, the IOC has made clear it will cut ties and move onto the next event.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean those actions don\u2019t pose a threat to the Olympic movement as a whole.\n\nWe need to talk\n\nBullock said the IOC and potential hosts need to begin having detailed conversations about the risks of hosting the Games, who will shoulder them and how. If that doesn\u2019t happen, he expects to see considerably fewer sites willing to host. That could put an abrupt end to resurgence of enthusiasm the IOC had just begun to see after changing its approach to the bid process last year \u2014 treating it less like a competition, which invited bribery and corruption, and more as a consultancy.\n\nAnd what is the future of the Olympics if no one wants to host them?\n\n\u201cIt certainly could deter cities,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the best interest of the entire Olympic movement, whether it\u2019s the IOC or the NOCs or organizing committees or the international federations to come together for some comprehensive planning around the risk.\n\n\u201cThis is a risk to the movement overall and all of these parties need to come together to address it so the cities who do want to be considered as future hosts have an answer to this issue.\u201d\n\nBullock said SLOC took an extremely frugal approach to putting on the 2002 Olympics, and the building wraps are a prime example of that. They weren\u2019t ordered until the organizers knew for certain that they could afford them.\n\n\u201cSix months out from the games, everything looked like it was going to go well. And so we started decorating the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe repercussions of the 9/11 tragedy took away some of that budget cushion, but Salt Lake City 2002 still ended up being one of the few Olympics in history to not lose money on the event.\n\nIt\u2019s because of that experience that Bullock said he feels comfortable pursuing another Olympics in Utah in 2030 or 2034. He said he sees considerable value in hosting the Games if they are handled right.\n\nAmong the benefits he listed is an infusion of cash into the state for economic development, which he estimates will reach $6 billion the next time Utah hosts the Games. The marketing reach, and its economic shockwaves, also can\u2019t be underestimated, he said. Plus, and he considered this the most compelling reason to bring the Games back, hosting an Olympics gives the locals an unequaled international experience.", "url": "https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2020/07/23/tokyo-summer-games-were/", "school_rgx": 2, "adminX": "Utah", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Utah\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

{"title": "'Swing County, USA' Prepares For Unprecedented Influx Of Ballots By Mail", "publish_date": null, "text": "The county government cafeteria in Northampton County, Pa., is a large, airy room with big windows and, for now, lunch tables separated by plexiglass.\n\nBut a few months from now, on Election Day, this is where the county plans to have a couple of dozen people processing what it expects could be 100,000 mail-in ballots, nearly triple what they handled in the June 2 primary and 15 times what they handled in November 2016.\n\nThe dramatic rise in mail-in ballots prompted the move of the counting operation to the cafeteria, one of many steps this swing county on the eastern edge of a battleground state is taking to prepare for this unprecedented presidential election.\n\n\"We're very supportive of it. It's just a little more work,\" says Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure Jr. \"Based on our experience from the primary, we just don't think it's physically possible to count the potential 100,000 mail-in ballots that day.\"\n\nPennsylvania is among the handful of states that could decide the outcome of the election if it's close. It voted twice for Barack Obama before pivoting to Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nLike many other places across the U.S., officials are anticipating a tremendous increase in the number of people voting by mail, because of changes in laws and coronavirus concerns. While there's little evidence that mail-in ballots are insecure, they do introduce logistical and other challenges.\n\n\"Every component piece of the process requires more \u2014 more dollars, more space, more staffing, more equipment. And earlier timelines,\" says Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar.\n\nHistorically, only about 5% of Pennsylvanians voted absentee. That was already set to change this year, as Pennsylvania joined more than 30 other states in allowing voting by mail for any reason, also known as no-excuse absentee voting.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf hailed the new law, passed last fall, as \"the biggest change to our elections in generations ... removing barriers to the voting booth and encouraging more people to vote.\"\n\nPennsylvania election officials say they expected a modest increase in mail-in voting in the 2020 primary, the first election under the new rules.\n\n\"And then COVID-19 hit,\" says Boockvar.\n\nStatewide, Pennsylvania saw a nearly 18-fold increase in mail-in voting in the June 2 primary, compared with four years ago. Boockvar anticipates that 50% of the state's voters could opt for mail-in voting this fall.\n\nThe sheer numbers, along with the complexities of counting mail-in ballots, have raised questions and lowered expectations about how soon there will be results \u2014 not just in Pennsylvania but across the country.\n\nFor months, President Trump has promoted the false narrative that mail-in voting will lead to fraud and a rigged election. To be clear, though there have been issues as the use of mail-in voting increases \u2014 such as ballots rejected for being late or unsigned \u2014 election experts say there is no evidence that voting by mail leads to rampant fraud.\n\nBut because of how time-consuming the process is, a big question remains: On election night, will voters know who is going to be the next president of the United States?\n\nIt's the \"million-dollar question,\" says Boockvar. \"I think that Nov. 3, we may not.\"\n\nBoockvar is hoping the Pennsylvania legislature will pass a measure that would allow ballots to be pre-canvassed, starting as early as three weeks before Nov. 3. That process includes opening both a ballot's outer envelope and secondary privacy envelope and confirming the voter's eligibility. Under current law, this work can't start until 7 a.m. on Election Day.\n\nThe final step, feeding the ballot into a scanner that counts the vote, would still happen on Election Day under the proposed legislation.\n\n\"That last part is the fastest part of the process,\" Boockvar says. \"It's all the other things, including literally the physical extraction of the documents in the envelope, that take a remarkable number of hours and days depending on how many ballots you get back.\"\n\nThis spring, things actually ran pretty smoothly in Northampton County, where officials proudly point out that they were the first in Pennsylvania to report election results in the June 2 primary, at around 9 p.m.\n\nStill, they say that without the ability to pre-canvass mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day in November, same-day results are unlikely.\n\n\"We'll have significant numbers on election night, but we won't be done unless the law changes,\" McClure, the county executive, says.\n\nThere is already a lot of interest in how Northampton County will vote come Nov. 3. The county, about 90 minutes from both Philadelphia and New York City, is looked to as a bellwether in presidential elections.\n\n\"If you go and look back historically all the way to the early part of the last century, you'd see that the way Northampton County goes, so does Pennsylvania,\" says Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, who lives in the borough of Nazareth, in the center of the county. \"It's really unbelievable as a predictor for the state as a whole.\"\n\nNorthampton County was one of three Pennsylvania counties that voted twice for Barack Obama before pivoting to Donald Trump. Trump won Pennsylvania by a mere 44,000 votes, a margin of less than 1%.\n\n\"We like to call ourselves Swing County, USA,\" says Sam Chen, a Republican strategist and political science professor who grew up in the steel town of Bethlehem, Pa.\n\nChen, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, says he hasn't decided yet whom he'll support this year, though he's leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nOne thing Chen has decided is that he will vote by mail, and he's expecting a lot of other Republicans to do the same, despite Trump's attacks on mail-in voting.\n\n\"It's going to come down to convenience,\" Chen says. \"Is it easier for me to vote in person?\"\n\nOthers are more skeptical. Frank DeVito, an attorney and one of two Republicans on the Northampton County Election Commission, says Trump's rhetoric railing against mail-in voting is resonating with Republican voters. In recent weeks, for instance, Trump has claimed without evidence that millions of ballots could be printed by foreign countries.\n\n\"Is it possible what he's saying? I mean, yeah, in theory,\" says DeVito, speaking at his home in Bath, Pa., with a \"Trump-Pence 2020\" sign in his front yard. \"Theoretically, when anybody who's a registered voter can mail a ballot in and never show up at a polling place, never sign in, it's more likely that you can commit fraud.\"\n\n\"On how wide of a scale is something like that going to happen?\" DeVito continues. \"It's likely that there will be a few paper ballots mailed to the wrong addresses and somebody will just use it. But on a systemic, widespread level, I really don't know. I think it's a real possibility.\"\n\nThere were already notable differences in how Republicans and Democrats chose to vote in Northampton County's June primary.\n\nAmong Democrats, 26,440 voted by mail, versus 10,051 who voted at the polls. Compare that with Republicans: 10,367 voted by mail, with 15,582 voting at the polls.\n\nNorthampton County Executive McClure, a Democrat, wants to get the word out that either form of voting is fine.\n\n\"It appears that Republicans prefer to vote in person, and we've got a great system for them, and they know their votes are going to count,\" McClure says. \"And it appears Democrats prefer to vote by mail at this juncture.\"\n\nAs the county election staff members await word on whether they will be able to pre-canvass the mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day, they're already in better shape than they were for the primary. They have purchased a third high-speed envelope-opening machine, known as an enveloper, which can slice open 24,000 envelopes per hour.\n\nMcClure says he has great confidence in the technology, in the backup systems and in the people running them.\n\n\"I'd die before I let this election be rigged,\" he says. \"There are some things that are greater in importance than a partisan victory: the sanctity and integrity of our elections.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2020 NPR.

Well, here's what we heard when we put that question to people either directly involved with or closely tracking the vote in Pennsylvania.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Million-dollar question (laughter).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I would probably say no.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That's a valid question. The answer might be no.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Not confident.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I think that we may not.\n\nKELLY: Pennsylvania is among the handful of states that could decide the outcome of the election if it's close. It was a battleground state in 2016, too. Trump won but barely - a margin of less than 1%. This November Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar told me she expects a sea change in the number of Pennsylvanians casting their ballots by mail.\n\nKATHY BOOCKVAR: I would expect that we would probably see about 50% cast by mail.\n\nKELLY: Wow - 50%. I mean, it's stunning.\n\nBOOCKVAR: It is stunning considering we've historically been 5%.\n\nKELLY: Now, while there's little evidence that mail ballots are not secure, they can take longer to count. So what are the implications of that? What if results are delayed by days, even weeks? We wanted to see how Pennsylvania is preparing, so we hopped in the car and pointed north up I-95.\n\nAnd we just crossed the state line crossing from Delaware over into Pennsylvania.\n\nKeep heading north, and you arrive at the part of Pennsylvania where we're going to spend these next minutes - the Lehigh Valley, Northampton County. We're here because in a key swing state, this is a key swing region. Politically, it's about as purple as you can get - one of just three counties in the whole state that went for Barack Obama twice then swung to Trump.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: So I'm calling the meeting to order.\n\nKELLY: We've just pulled up to the outdoor meeting of the Democratic Women of Nazareth and Vicinity, a couple dozen women spread out and socially distanced on park benches, everybody wearing masks.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED GROUP: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.\n\nKELLY: It's their first meeting since the pandemic hit. They tell us the virus makes it tough to knock on doors, so they are kicking off a postcard campaign. And they are focused - really focused - on the possibilities of voting by mail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Can I just have a show of hands of how many people already have registered to get their mail-ins?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: For November?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: For November.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: I tried to get on, and they said they...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Votepa.com.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: OK.\n\nKELLY: Here's the thing. You used to have to give a reason if you wanted to vote by mail in Pennsylvania. That law changed last year. So election officials were expecting a modest increase in mail ballots for 2020. Then came the coronavirus. This spring, as the primary loomed, poll workers quit. They were worried about getting sick. Voters were worried about getting sick. Pennsylvania postponed its April primary, and by the time they held it last month, record numbers of ballots poured in by mail.\n\nAMY HESS: This is our new office.\n\nKELLY: Amy Hess, deputy registrar of elections for Northampton County - she's giving us a tour around the county government offices in Easton.\n\nHESS: So this is our locked ballot room with a security camera.\n\nKELLY: Offices which they have had to reconfigure given the unique challenges of 2020. Hess shows us where they set up tables on primary day to accommodate all the workers slicing open envelopes, extracting the ballot.\n\nHESS: What took the longest was unfolding it and flattening it out.\n\nKELLY: Now, in Northampton County, primary day went pretty smoothly according to county executive Lamont McClure.\n\nLAMONT MCCLURE: We were the first county in Pennsylvania to have our complete results in.\n\nKELLY: Really?\n\nMCCLURE: Yes.\n\nKELLY: Results in by 9 p.m. But on November 3 they are bracing for a tsunami - a hundred thousand mail in ballots in this county alone. Under current state law, counties cannot start confirming voter eligibility or start opening envelopes until the morning of Election Day. There is a push for the state legislature to change that in these next few weeks, a change which McClure - a Democrat - told me would make a big difference.\n\nMCCLURE: Based on our experience from the primary, we just don't think it's physically possible to count the potential 100,000 mail-in ballots that day.\n\nKELLY: Now, McClure is talking about a delay of hours in reporting results. But it is worth injecting here in other parts of Pennsylvania, there are still races from the June 2 primary where we don't yet have an official winner. So imagine a scenario where days, a week after the presidential election, votes are being counted, lawsuits are being filed and questions are being asked about the legitimacy of the election. This is a scenario being fed by the man trying to win reelection. The president has tweeted inaccurately about widespread mail-in ballot fraud and warned of a rigged 2020 election and that results could be delayed for months. I asked Lamont McClure if he's worried.\n\nMCCLURE: We're not worried about fraud at all, and we're not worried about a rigged election in Northampton County. I would - I'm a Democrat. I'm going to be for Joe Biden. I'd die before I let this election be rigged.\n\nFRANK DEVITO: Is President Trump's - is it possible what he's saying? Yeah, in theory. I mean, I think it's easier...\n\nKELLY: This is Frank DeVito - attorney, Republican, member of the Northampton County Election Commission - a Trump Pence 2020 sign planted in his front yard. His toddler children came out to greet us, and then we sat at a picnic table, a rooster crowing from the next yard over. DeVito agrees there is no evidence that voting by mail leads to massive fraud. But he plans to vote in person, and he is sympathetic to the president's view that doing otherwise creates problems.\n\nDEVITO: If you show up physically, you sign a paper, you vote, the chain of custody is very limited. But when things are going out to a mailbox and then back to the voter registration office sometimes weeks before the election and then more of them come in on Election Day that are being dropped off in boxes at the courthouse - the county is doing their best. It's not a free-for-all where just mail-in ballots are going to go disappearing in suitcases. I certainly don't think so. So I would give reassurances, but I would give guarded reassurances that I still think there are a lot more holes in the system.\n\nKELLY: For the record, again, there is no proof that mail ballots have posed significant threat to election security. But public trust can be fragile. The perception of chaos can be as damaging and as polarizing as actual chaos. The local Democratic Party is already busy trying to manage expectations, pumping out the message on social media that it may take a while to know who won in Pennsylvania and the most important thing is to get an accurate count. I was curious if that message is resonating and, just generally, what's on voters' minds here - so one more stop.\n\nWe've pulled up now to Bethlehem, one of the cities in Northampton County, making our way down Main Street, which is so pretty - old, historic, brick sidewalks, benches out, people sitting on them, eating ice cream.\n\nWe walked up and down Main Street, talking with people for a while. And then we got lucky because if you were trying to capture the diversity of political views in this corner of Pennsylvania, you could not do better than these two adjacent tables on a shady sidewalk outside the Spanish tapas bar and restaurant.\n\nABIGAIL ILLINGWORTH: Hey there. Hi.\n\nKELLY: Can we say hi? We are journalists from NPR.\n\nAt the table farther from the curb, Abigail Illingworth - she's from Hellertown, another town nearby, about to start senior year in college. This is her first time voting in a presidential election.\n\nThis is quite an election to have it be your first one.\n\nILLINGWORTH: It sure is. Yeah, it sure is (laughter).\n\nKELLY: Who are you voting for?\n\nILLINGWORTH: I do believe I will be going with Biden.\n\nKELLY: For Biden.\n\nILLINGWORTH: Yes.\n\nKELLY: Can you give me a sense why?\n\nILLINGWORTH: I just do not agree with President Trump's policies or beliefs whatsoever - any of them.\n\nKELLY: Illingworth dismisses the president's warnings of fraud and a rigged election, and she's appalled at his handling of the pandemic. Trump's long refusal to wear a mask, she says, sets a very poor example. Just a few feet away, polishing off what looked like a tiny tostada sat Iliana. She declined to give her last name for privacy reasons. She's 39 years old, works at one of the big hospitals in the Lehigh Valley, also a Trump voter.\n\nILIANA: I feel like he is the only president that is come in not as a politician and more of a businessman and more aware of trying to protect the economy as well as trying to limit some of the drug trafficking that's coming - going on in America as well. I definitely think that the media portrays him to be more of a bad person than he actually is.\n\nKELLY: What about the pandemic, I asked. What do you make of how he's handled it?\n\nILIANA: I definitely think that, you know, it is something to be concerned about. But at the same time, I do think that the media is portraying it to be a lot bigger than what it is.\n\nKELLY: After that, Iliana circled back a third time in our short interview to what she sees as unfair reporting on the president - fake news. On the next block under a wide green awning with Johnny's Bagel and Deli spelled across it, we'd arranged to meet Samuel Chen, GOP staffer-turned-consultant. He used to work for former Republican Gov. John Kasich, former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent and others. He has never voted for a Democrat at the top of the ticket before, but...\n\nSAMUEL CHEN: I consider myself an undecided Republican voter who, in the moment, is leaning toward Vice President Biden.\n\nKELLY: Leaning but not quite there yet. He wants to see who Biden picks as his running mate. Chen grew up near here. Over iced coffees, we talked about the region's reputation as a bellwether for the rest of the state and Pennsylvania's outsized role in the national outcome.\n\nCHEN: I think the election swings on people like me and on these undecideds because we know how Texas is going to go. We know how California is going to go. We're looking at a handful of states and a handful of voters in those states.\n\nKELLY: Chen communicated something I sensed from other people we interviewed here - the weight of responsibility they feel for making sure Pennsylvania doesn't blow it on November 3.\n\nCHEN: Now you have the mail-in issue. There is a lot of concern among election officials, Republican and Democrat, of making sure we get this right. And how do we make sure we don't call it too early and have to retract it? But how do we make sure we're not a month afterwards and the whole country is saying, hey, Pennsylvania. Do you have election result yet? - especially if it swings on this state.\n\nKELLY: The worst-case scenario, Sam Chen says - what happened in Florida in 2000 but updated for the Twitter era and unfolding during a pandemic. For those who need a refresher, in 2000 - Bush versus Gore - Americans waited 36 days to learn who'd won.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JOEY PECORARO'S \"HERE WE ARE AGAIN\") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.", "url": "https://www.upr.org/post/swing-county-usa-prepares-unprecedented-influx-ballots-mail", "school_rgx": 6, "adminX": "Utah", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Utah\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "Utah Jazz stars Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert and the rift between them", "publish_date": null, "text": "Donovan Mitchell says he and Rudy Gobert are back on good terms after they both tested positive for COVID-19 back in March. (0:39)\n\nTHE DAY AFTER Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus, triggering the suspension of the NBA season, the Utah Jazz center tried to get in touch with his co-star, Donovan Mitchell. Gobert had just learned that Mitchell was the only other member of the team's 58-person traveling party to test positive.\n\nGobert called Mitchell on March 12, then texted and later direct-messaged him on Instagram. Mitchell didn't respond.\n\nEarlier that afternoon, Gobert had apologized in an Instagram post to the people he had potentially exposed to the virus, calling his behavior \"careless.\" Two days before his positive result, the 7-foot-1 Frenchman touched all the microphones and recording devices in front of him at a news conference, jokingly mocking the NBA's new physical distancing media policies. Gobert's hunch that Mitchell was upset with him was soon confirmed by a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nMitchell acknowledged during a \"Good Morning America\" appearance four days after his positive test that \"it took me a while to kind of cool off,\" but he avoided the question about whether he had been in touch with Gobert.\n\nUtah's franchise cornerstones went weeks without any communication, and Mitchell didn't comment again publicly until July 2. The silence fueled speculation about whether the Jazz would have to choose between their All-Stars, even if people within the organization considered the rift between Mitchell and Gobert overblown, believing it could have been managed relatively easily if they had to be in the same locker room.\n\nThere had long been friction between the two, the kind typical with NBA duos, particularly if those star players are relatively early in their careers -- and especially in a roller-coaster season such as this one for the Jazz, who have basically played .500 ball aside from a 19-2 run in December and January. One high-ranking Jazz source categorized the pre-pandemic issues between the 28-year-old Gobert and Mitchell, 23, as \"a 2 out of 10 on the NBA drama scale.\"\n\nBut when their strained relationship following the positive tests lingered in public view for months, it increased the intensity of their issues and put a spotlight on an already-tense dynamic. It's a spotlight that was created because, according to sources, Mitchell blamed Gobert for infecting him with COVID-19.\n\n\"You know, I tried to put myself in his shoes,\" Gobert told ESPN. \"There was a lot of fear, and I think more than anything, he reacted out of fear. That's why I don't really blame him. We all have different character; we all react differently. When it's something like that, when he tested [positive] for a virus that we don't know a lot about, it's scary. It was scary for me, and I'm sure it was scary for him.\n\n\"The most important thing is what you do from there.\"\n\nJoe Ingles, a respected veteran whose wry sense of humor is often an important element of the Jazz's chemistry, privately told them several weeks into the hiatus that it would be selfish and hurt their teammates if the stars held grudges against each other.\n\nThe Jazz wanted to start virtual team meetings and workouts, but Gobert told teammates in early April that he wouldn't feel right participating until he had a discussion with Mitchell. A month into the NBA hiatus, Gobert and Mitchell talked.\n\n\"We told each other what we had to say to each other,\" Gobert said. \"We are both on the same page. We both want to win. We both think that we have a great opportunity, and we know that we need each other. We talked about a lot of things, but the main thing was that we are on the same page and the fact that our team needs us. We can win together. That's the most important thing.\"\n\nWhen Mitchell spoke on July 2, he said he was ready to move on.\n\n\"Right now, we're good,\" Mitchell said in a virtual news conference with reporters. (He declined requests to comment for this story through his agent.) \"We're going out there ready to hoop.\"\n\nThat aligned with Gobert's feelings about moving forward.\n\n\"The virus or not, it's never perfect,\" Gobert said. \"Relationships are never perfect. The most important thing is to have respect for one another.\"\n\nBoth Mitchell and Gobert are in line for big raises, and the team plans to keep building around them. But amid the public revelation of these long-simmering tensions, the Jazz face a question: Is the future of the organization secure in the hands of two players who aren't friendly with each other?\n\nMORE: What to know about the Jazz and all 22 teams in Orlando\n\nAfter Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert became the first two NBA players to test positive for the coronavirus, their relationship was put under the microscope. Soobum Im/USA TODAY Sports\n\nGOBERT HAD JUST put the finishing touches on one of his most dominant performances, an 18-point, 25-rebound, two-block, plus-20 outing in a Jan. 14, 2019, home win over the Detroit Pistons. He had dominated two-time All-Star center Andre Drummond for the team's sixth win in seven games, a couple of weeks before the coaches made their selections for All-Star reserves. Jazz TV sideline reporter Kristen Kenney corralled Gobert for the postgame interview, which played over the speakers at Vivint Smart Home Arena.\n\nMidway through the interview, Gobert's attention was diverted by Mitchell, who often playfully interrupts teammates' postgame TV hits, sometimes squirting them with water. As a smiling Mitchell sneaked up from behind and made some silly sounds, Gobert looked over his left shoulder and delivered a one-liner into the microphone:\n\n\"Hey, pass the ball, goddamn it!\"\n\nMitchell, who had 28 points on 21 shots and two assists, laughed and turned toward the tunnel to the Jazz locker room, altering his path to give high-fives to a couple of kids in the courtside seats who were wearing his No. 45 jersey.\n\nIt was a moment that made many within the Jazz organization uncomfortable. They knew Gobert's quip contained a lot of truth about his feelings on Mitchell's passing.\n\nGobert rarely hesitates to let teammates know if they miss him when he is open around the rim. He'll occasionally point up during play in animated fashion, sometimes as he is running back on defense, to note that a lob should have been thrown. He'll often air his gripes verbally, during games and again in film sessions.\n\n\"Rudy has to pick his spots, and Donovan can't react to everything. Sometimes you have to play chess and appease your teammates. ... Is it about you trying to prove your point to one another or us trying to win?\"\n\nMitchell hears it the most, simply because as the Jazz's go-to guy, he has the ball in his hands the most. That, according to several Jazz sources, has been the primary irritant in an overall successful partnership.\n\n\"If you take a paper towel and just drip water on it, the paper towel is going to get moist and then it's going to get damp and eventually it's going to break,\" a Jazz source said. \"Rudy has to pick his spots, and Donovan can't react to everything. Sometimes you have to play chess and appease your teammates.\n\n\"It's not about being right all the time. Sometimes it's like, 'It happened and let's move on.' Is it about you trying to prove your point to one another or us trying to win?\"\n\nGobert acknowledges that Mitchell and other Jazz teammates have passed him the ball a lot, considering he set an NBA record in 2018-19 for the most dunks in a season since shot types started being recorded in 2000.\n\nGobert also understands that whether he is right often is irrelevant if the tone and timing of his delivery are off-putting, something frequently stressed by Jazz assistant coach Alex Jensen, whose blunt, direct approach has guided Gobert's development from skinny project to one of the NBA's premier big men. Gobert knows his lobbying for lobs wears on teammates to the point of being counterproductive, like the wide receiver who gripes at the quarterback after every play when a pass isn't thrown his way, regardless of the pass rush.\n\n\"I understand that I'm annoying. I can be very annoying,\" said Gobert, adding that he knows Mitchell's job is difficult as the focal point of defenses. \"I think maybe because he was really good really early, I've been very demanding and maybe in not always a positive way. Sometimes you don't realize it.\n\n\"Like with me, people can be hard on me and I can handle it, but for some guys, it can become very frustrating. I can understand that 100 percent. Donovan has gotten better every year since he's gotten here. I think he's going to keep getting a lot better. It's pretty much, I'm the a--hole.\"\n\nGOBERT INSISTS THAT the reason he is so demanding of his teammates, and Mitchell in particular, is that he is so proud of what the Jazz have built during his career that he refuses to lower his standards.\n\nUtah won 25 games during Gobert's rookie season, when he spent much of his time in the then D-League, and the Jazz didn't finish with a winning record or make the playoffs until his fourth campaign. Their lone All-Star, Gordon Hayward, bolted for the Boston Celtics in free agency weeks after that first postseason taste. But after getting a glimpse of Mitchell tearing up the summer leagues, Gobert boldly declared that the Jazz would be just as good without their departed leading scorer.\n\nGobert was unexpectedly proved right when Mitchell showed within the first month of his career that he was capable of carrying a heavier offensive burden in the NBA than he did at Louisville, a role much larger than the Jazz anticipated when they traded up to select him with the 13th pick of the 2017 draft.\n\nMitchell, who is the son of a New York Mets executive and considered baseball his main sport until he was 16, readily acknowledges that he is still learning on the fly as a primary playmaker. He often says making reads is the area of his game that requires the most work. There also are times when he tries to do too much, common for young stars.\n\n\"Sometimes he'll try to be the hero and take big shots,\" a Jazz source said. \"I know he wants to be the guy, but sometimes the play is right in front of you and he needs to pass the ball. He has to grow in that area and trust his teammates more.\"\n\nUtah coach Quin Snyder and his staff have attempted to help facilitate that trust, especially between Mitchell and Gobert. That duo have had dozens of two-man workouts under the watch of coaches, with a focus on ironing out intricacies of their pick-and-roll partnership and lob chemistry. They also occasionally join coaches -- usually some combination of Snyder, Jensen and Johnnie Bryant, the assistant who works most with Mitchell -- for small-group film sessions at the team's facility.\n\nThose sessions typically -- perhaps fittingly -- take place in either the Stockton Room or the Malone Room. The rooms, located next to each other, are decorated with photos of John Stockton and Karl Malone, further honoring the legends whose statues sit outside the arena near the intersection of the streets named after them.\n\nIt's another reminder of the high standard for teamwork in Utah, lessons the young stars are still learning.\n\n\"It's all about how we learn to try to have empathy for one another,\" Gobert said. \"The best teams, it's never perfect, but you understand your strengths and you understand how to make each other better. You want to make each other better.\"\n\nIn recent comments, both Gobert and Mitchell mentioned the Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant partnership that produced three titles for the Los Angeles Lakers as proof that co-stars don't have to necessarily be friends to be successful. (They also both noted that they weren't trying to compare themselves to the legends in terms of talent or production.)\n\n\"For us, it's like, there's going to be tension,\" said Mitchell, who was adamant that their long-uneasy relationship didn't influence his reaction toward Gobert after testing positive for the coronavirus. \"There's going to be back-and-forth. Obviously, I feel like I should be right here, he feels like he should be right there. But it's always going to happen. It happens on every team ...\n\n\"So I feel like in a work environment, you're not going to always get along or go out to eat and hang out with your teammates. So that's that.\"\n\nJAZZ COACHES CONSIDER the screen assist -- crediting a player for setting a pick that leads directly to a teammate's basket -- a gift from the stat geeks.\n\nIt's been available on the NBA's stats site since the start of the 2016-17 season. Gobert has ranked first or tied for first in screen assists in each of those seasons.\n\nIt's tangible evidence that Gobert is the best in the game at something that had long fallen under the category of an intangible, a way of helping teammates score that is rarely noticed by casual fans and never appears in a traditional box score.\n\n\"I just think it helps my team win, and if it does, I'm going to keep doing it,\" Gobert said.\n\nPublicly and privately, Gobert constantly emphasizes that winning is his top priority. He embraces doing the dirty work necessary to achieve that goal -- but also craves the recognition for doing so.\n\nGobert is a back-to-back NBA Defensive Player of the Year, but the Jazz big man knows Mitchell's game resonates more with fans. \"He's more fun to watch than me. ... I totally understand how it works, and I'm fine with it,\" Gobert said. Gary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt's no secret that being snubbed for a couple of All-Star Games really stung Gobert. He believed he had earned a spot, a contention supported by advanced statistics; he has ranked among the NBA's top four players in win shares in three of the past four seasons, the lone exception being when injuries limited him to 56 games in 2016-17. Gobert memorably teared up the day after All-Star reserves were announced in 2019 -- and he wasn't included -- while discussing his mother's disappointment at a post-practice media availability.\n\nThat's why some within the Jazz organization wonder whether Gobert has subconsciously allowed his motivation and relationships to be muddied by his thirst for status -- and, by extension, statistics.\n\n\"I can totally see that,\" Gobert said, referring to concern that he had started caring too much about scoring.\n\n\"The thing is, it's a paradox, because I play every game to win. I compete every single possession to win. Of course you want accomplishments. You want legacy. When you realize that you help your team win and you're still not selected ...\"\n\nGobert's voice trailed off mid-sentence. Those snubs still sting, even after he made his All-Star debut along with Mitchell this season, adding to a list of honors headlined by two All-NBA selections and two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards.\n\n\"When you want to be the best at your position, the best at what you do, you want the accolades that go with it,\" Gobert continued. \"When you do your best to help your team win, your team is winning, and then you get snubbed for people that get better numbers that don't win as much or maybe don't have the same impact, then it's like, what do I need to do more?\"\n\nThat, Gobert added, certainly doesn't make him an exception. As he put it, \"every single player in the NBA thinks about his stats.\"\n\nThat desire for acknowledgement -- or to prove doubters wrong -- has been a driving force in Gobert's ascent. He wears No. 27 as a constant reminder that he slid to the 27th pick in the 2013 draft. A scroll through his likes on Twitter reveals an NBA star who searches for both disrespect and praise as fuel. It's also why the Jazz strength coaches don't include upper-body work in Gobert's weightlifting program, knowing he'll get those reps in for the sake of shirtless selfie posts on Instagram.\n\nSome close to Gobert believe this blend of insecurity and vanity is rooted in his experience growing up in France as a gangly kid with glasses.\n\n\"Part of it is he's always trying to overcome being that goofy kid in high school,\" a Jazz source said. \"It's that constant never enough, which is good, but it's also been bad.\"\n\nIt's against that backdrop that Mitchell's marketing success and popularity, particularly as compared to that of Gobert, are seen by some in Utah as sensitive subjects. It can be categorized more as an awareness than a concern in the organization, but there have been cringes when a SportsCenter highlight package focuses on a Mitchell dunk or two after Gobert dominated in a Jazz win.\n\n\"If I was 12 years old, I wouldn't want to be watching f---ing Rudy Gobert. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell.\"\n\nGobert, however, insists he doesn't mind that Mitchell has a signature shoe deal with Adidas and a Stance Socks shop in a Salt Lake City mall -- the sort of marketing opportunities beyond Gobert's reach.\n\n\"He's the governor, not the mayor,\" one source joked about Mitchell, who plays to Utah fans by asking for tips on finding good Fourth of July barbecues or high school basketball games, then showing up.\n\nGobert sees the same thing in Mitchell that the marketing executives do -- a charismatic young star with a flashy game, a polish developed while attending prestigious New England prep schools, the cachet of winning the Slam Dunk Contest as a rookie and the powerhouse Creative Artists Agency pushing his brand.\n\nBut Gobert also sees Mitchell's dedication to working on his game behind the scenes.\n\n\"Obviously, a lot of things happened really fast for him, but I don't think he ever lost track of what's really important,\" the big man said.\n\nIf Mitchell is seen as the face of the Jazz franchise, Gobert is adamant it's just fine with him.\n\n\"I don't mind Donovan being in the spotlight more than I am,\" Gobert said. \"I want to win games. That's it. At the end of the day, it's not like I [don't] have any spotlight.\n\n\"Donovan has a very bright personality and all that, and the way he plays, he's more fun to watch than me,\" Gobert added. \"If I was 12 years old, I wouldn't want to be watching f---ing Rudy Gobert. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell. I wouldn't want to watch Rudy Gobert get dunks and alter shots. I'd want to watch Donovan Mitchell cross people up and do crazy layups, crazy dunks, of course.\n\n\"I totally understand how it works, and I'm fine with it.\"\n\nGobert, Mitchell and the Jazz have fallen to the Rockets in each of the past two postseasons. Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports\n\nEXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT of basketball operations Dennis Lindsey and the rest of the Jazz front office certainly don't see any need to entertain thoughts of choosing between Gobert or Mitchell. Both players have committed to move forward together, both in conversations between the players and the ownership group, front office, coaching staff and with their teammates.\n\n\"This isn't, 'Whose team is it?' like Steph Marbury and Kevin Garnett in Minnesota,\" a Jazz source said. \"This is trying to figure out how to win. The things that bind them together is they're both competitive as hell, they both want to win and they both know they need each other.\"\n\nThe decision to give Mitchell, who has a year remaining on his rookie contract, a maximum deal before he can test restricted free agency qualifies as a no-brainer.\n\nGobert's looming contract negotiations are likely to be more complicated, as he is a potential 2021 unrestricted free agent eligible for a supermax extension this summer, which could put a small-market franchise in a financial crunch. But the Jazz have been clear that they plan to build around the pair for the foreseeable future. Nothing that has happened since March 11, when their game in Oklahoma City was called off seconds before the scheduled tip, has altered that thinking.\n\n\"As we've stated before, we're looking to add players with the physical talent and the competitive makeup of Donovan and Rudy,\" Lindsey said. \"By definition, we want to build around them moving forward.\"\n\nThere's even hope within the organization that this saga could lead Gobert and Mitchell, who are neighbors in the home locker room but don't often socialize outside of team dinners and outings, to have more productive conversations with each other.\n\n\"When adversity comes, it can pull the group together or it can push them away,\" a team source said. \"That's the reality of the situation. It's up to them.\"\n\nMitchell expressed regret that the attention his rift with Gobert generated \"took away from what the guys on the team were trying to do\" and said moving forward he wishes and believes that the Jazz will \"focus on the team as a whole.\"\n\nAsked why he didn't address the dynamic with Gobert publicly for 3\u00bd months, whether via social media or in an interview, Mitchell said his initial feelings were no secret and he didn't see value in trying to shoot down a report from The Athletic that quoted an anonymous source describing the situation as \"unsalvageable.\"\n\n\"We know what it is internally as a team, and that should be it,\" Mitchell said. \"That's part of that maturity and growing up. I could have easily gone back and forth with whoever on Twitter and kind of addressed it, but I'm just like, you know what, there's no need for that. My teammates and my coaches know how I feel, and I feel like that was over with. That's it, and I'm leaving it at that.\"\n\nThere isn't an expectation that Gobert and Mitchell will suddenly form a close friendship. But that isn't necessary for the Jazz co-stars -- completely different personalities but complementary on-court pieces -- to continue as one of the NBA's most productive duos.\n\n\"I think we can accomplish some great things, so that's the moral of the story,\" Gobert said. \"It's never going to be perfect. Sometimes we're going to be very happy, and sometimes we're going to be frustrated with each other.\n\n\"But as long as we, as men, respect each other and keep things between him and myself, and approach it as men, we're going to be fine.\"", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29406398/utah-jazz-stars-donovan-mitchell-rudy-gobert-rift-them", "school_rgx": 2, "adminX": "Utah", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Utah\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 USA Today says that a column that the newspaper solicited and published from presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro criticizing Dr. Anthony Fauci was misleading and did not meet fact-checking standards.\n\nThe newspaper explained the decision in a note by Bill Sternberg, editorial page editor, attached to the column online. Navarro\u2019s column originally moved online late Tuesday and was published in Wednesday\u2019s newspaper.\n\nNavarro wrote that Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, \u201chas been wrong about everything I interacted with him on.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper on Wednesday evening also ran a fact-check storyby Washington reporter Ledyard King examining five of Navarro\u2019s claims.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how Navarro\u2019s column escaped such scrutiny before being published. Sternberg said in an email that he\u2019s letting his editorial note speak for itself. The incident is reminiscent of The New York Times saying last monththat an opinion column by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton hadn\u2019t been properly vetted, which led to the resignation of the paper\u2019s opinion editor.\n\nNavarro did not immediately return a message for comment.\n\nUSA Today said it had sought Navarro\u2019s opinion to accompany an editorial that the newspaper ran calling Fauci \u201ca national treasure.\u201d\n\nThat editorial said the fact that Navarro was writing the opposing viewpoint \u201cshows how hard it is to find an actual medical professional willing to undercut Fauci.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear whether the newspaper sought those opinions.\n\nFauci has essentially been shelved by the White House as a prominent spokesperson on the coronavirus pandemic because he\u2019s publicly been more pessimistic than the president.

{"title": "The Perfect Weekend Getaway: Moab From Denver", "publish_date": "06-24-2020 14:36", "text": "Our new series on weekend road trips aims to inspire you for what's to come as we slowly return to travel.\n\nCovid-19 Disclaimer: Make sure to check the status of the states, regions, and establishments in which you\u2019re planning to visit prior to travel. Many regions continue to see high infection rates and deaths, while many states and counties remain under varying stay-at-home orders. Those traveling from areas with high rates of Covid-19 should consider avoiding travel for now in order to reduce spread.\n\nWith two national parks just 30 minutes from each other, Moab is Utah\u2019s basecamp for adventure. One of the Southwest\u2019s greatest landscapes, many of the desert playground\u2019s most sought-after views are accessible to the casual traveler, but for intrepid adventurers looking to challenge themselves and get off the grid, there\u2019s plenty of backcountries to get wonderfully lost in as well.\n\nGETTING THERE\n\nAn easy five-and-a-half-hour drive due west, the route from Denver takes you past scenic mountain towns like Breckenridge, Vail, and Glenwood Springs on I-70. You\u2019ll continue through Grand Junction until you reach the Utah border where you\u2019ve basically made it.\n\nINSIDER TIP Stop in Palisade, Colorado\u2019s secret wine region to pick up provisions en route.\n\nDAY 1\n\nIf you leave early enough, you should arrive by mid-afternoon and can stop at Moab Brewery to fuel up. The town\u2019s largest restaurant and only microbrewery and distillery, it\u2019s basic pub fare (i.e. burgers and wings) and a good spot to try some of the local spirits. Their signature pour, Dead Horse Ale, takes its name from the popular viewpoint and should get you amped up and ready to explore.\n\nIf you\u2019re not too tired of being in the car, the Canyonlands Loop at sunset is simply stunning. Canyonlands National Park is much bigger than Arches (almost five times the size), and yet sees about half the number of tourists. It\u2019s more spread out, which makes touring a challenge, but does have an easy 34-mile drive loop to some of the highlights such as Island in the Sky. Snap some photos, do a short hike or two, and stretch your legs before heading to your hotel to freshen up.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, head back out to the main drag for dinner. Antica Forma is the town\u2019s beloved Italian joint and just the carb-fest you need to prep for tomorrow\u2019s activities. Known for their wood-fired pizzas made in and flown all the way from Naples, they have traditional red pies and more unique toppings like pistachio. Hit the hay early because you\u2019ll need to rest up for tomorrow\u2019s festivities.\n\nDAY 2\n\nGrab a coffee and breakfast burrito from Love Muffin Caf\u00e9, plus a panini or some snacks for the road. Since you\u2019ll be out most of the day, you\u2019ll want to pack sustenance and enough water for a day in the desert.\n\nHome to more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches, Arches National Park is the gem of the national park system. Your first stop is one you\u2019ll recognize from the Utah license plate. Delicate Arch is the park\u2019s most iconic hike and a must-see, which you can view from afar at the .5 miles Upper Viewpoint or up close on the 3-mile trail.\n\nFor a more challenging trek, Devils Garden Loop will take you to a handful of the park\u2019s most prominent arches in 1.9-7.9 miles. They each have varying degrees of difficulty and altitude gain, so plan accordingly and know your endurance level. It can take most of the day if you\u2019re keen on covering a lot of ground.\n\nIf you plan well enough in advance, Fiery Furnace is another coveted adventure in Arches National Park. Reservations and permits are required to hike this naturally formed rock labyrinth. You\u2019ll either have to go with a guide or watch a video at the ranger station to learn how to maneuver your way out of the twists and turns of this intriguing canyon maze that has no trails or markers.\n\nYou can spend the full day at Arches, but if you\u2019d rather beat the heat, river trips are also extremely popular. Full-day or half-day whitewater excursions down the Colorado and Westwater Canyon range in difficulty from class II-V. Whether you\u2019re looking for a lazy day on the water or roaring rapids, whitewater rafting in Moab is another summer must.\n\nAfter a long day of exploring, head to Moab Garage for a sweet treat. Their liquid nitrogen ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, and donuts are the perfect mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Looking as much like a science experiment as a snack, the cold feels great after a long day in the blazing sun.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve showered and cleaned up, stake out a seat at Blu Pig patio, which boasts barbecue and blues. With live music seven nights a week, it\u2019s undoubtedly the town gathering place. Cooked slow and low, tender ribs and tri-tip taste even better to a soundtrack of reckless abandon before you tuck in for the evening.\n\nDAY 3\n\nYou have time for one more half-day excursion, so make it count. Mountain biking, rock climbing, canyoneering, and ATV tours are all wildly popular ways to explore the insane scenery, which makes it a bit of a choose your own adventure.\n\nGive canyoneering a try, as it\u2019s a sport so uniquely attuned to the landscape you just can\u2019t do it anywhere else. Essentially the opposite of rock climbing, by the laws of physics, what goes up, must come down. Rappelling, scrambling, and wading through the slot canyons over waterfalls, it\u2019s an amazing, surprisingly less technical adventure suitable for just about any fitness level.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve dried off and packed up, mingle over one last meal before you head back. Open since the \u201960s, Moab Diner is the quintessential roadside cafe that can satisfy any carb craving. From big juicy burgers to runny eggs, splurge on a malt, brown butter sundae, or banana split before hitting the road in time to make it back for dinner.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nMost of the area hotels are basic, no-frills crash pads, so many people choose to save their money and camp. If that\u2019s not your thing, the Sorrel River Ranch is the ultimate splurge. As the only luxury resort in Moab, expect the custom-built ranch cabins, signature spa services, and privately guided excursions.\n\nFor a more accessible place to rest your head, the Castle Valley Inn Bed and Breakfast is a delightful little hideaway with homemade pastries, beautiful grounds, and a garden hot tub to soak in the views.\n\nWHEN TO GO\n\nSpring and fall are peak seasons in Moab as the weather is more attuned to outdoor activities. Summertime can see temperatures soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes desert explorations difficult. Winter can be an intriguing time to visit as the crowds have subsided, albeit many of the hikes do get icy.", "url": "https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/utah/moab-and-southeastern-utah/experiences/news/the-perfect-weekend-getaway-moab-from-denver", "school_rgx": 1, "adminX": "Utah", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Utah\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
{"title": "'Fang'tastic: researchers report amphibians with snake-like dental glands", "publish_date": "07-24-2020 00:00", "text": "LOGAN, UTAH, USA - Utah State University biologist Edmund 'Butch' Brodie, Jr. and colleagues from S\u00e3o Paulo's Butantan Institute report the first known evidence of oral venom glands in amphibians. Their research, supported by the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, appears in the July 3, 2020, issue of iScience.\n\n\"We think of amphibians - frogs, toads and the like -- as basically harmless,\" says Brodie, emeritus professor in USU's Department of Biology. \"We know a number of amphibians store nasty, poisonous secretions in their skin to deter predators. But to learn at least one can inflict injury from its mouth is extraordinary.\"\n\nBrodie and his colleagues discovered the oral glands in a family of caecilians, serpent-like creatures related to frogs and salamanders. Neither snakes nor worms, caecilians are found in tropical climates of Africa, Asian and the Americas. Some are aquatic and some, like the ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) studied by Brodie's team, live in burrows of their own making.\n\nIn 2018, the team reported the species secreted substances from skin glands at both ends of its snake-like body. Concentrated at the head and extending the length of the body, the creature emits a mucous-like lubricant that enables it to quickly dive underground to escape predators. At the tail, caecilians have glands armed with a toxin, which acts as a last line of chemical defense, blocking a hastily burrowed tunnel from hungry hunters.\n\n\"What we didn't know is these caecilians have tiny fluid-filled glands in the upper and lower jaw, with long ducts that open at the base of each of their spoon-shaped teeth,\" Brodie says.\n\nHis research colleague Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, who studied with Brodie as a visiting graduate student at USU's Logan campus in 2015, noticed the never-before-described oral glands. Using embryonic analysis, Mailho-Fontana, first author of the paper, discovered the glands - called \"dental glands\" - originated from a different tissue than the slime and poison glands found in the caecilian's skin.\n\n\"The poisonous skin glands form from the epidermis, but these oral glands develop from the dental tissue, and this is the same developmental origin we find in the venom glands of reptiles,\" he says.\n\nThe researchers surmise caecilians, equipped with no limbs and only a mouth for hunting, activate their oral glands when they bite down on prey, including worms, termites, frogs and lizards.\n\nThe team doesn't yet know the biochemical composition of the fluid held in the oral glands.\n\n\"If we can verify the secretions are toxic, these glands could indicate an early evolutionary design of oral venom organs,\" Brodie says. \"They may have evolved in caecilians earlier than in snakes.\"\n\n###", "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-07/usu-rr063020.php", "school_rgx": 0, "adminX": "Utah", "adminY": "USA", "query": "\"Utah\", USA AND (\"covid\" OR \"coronavirus\") AND (\"delay\" OR \"close\")"}
